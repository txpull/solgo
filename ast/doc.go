/*
Package ast provides an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation for Solidity contracts.
The ast package offers a set of data structures and functions to parse Solidity source code
and construct an AST that represents the structure and semantics of the contracts.
The package supports the creation of nodes for various Solidity constructs such as contracts,
functions, modifiers, variables, statements, expressions, events, errors, enums, structs,
and more. It also includes utilities for traversing and inspecting the AST, as well as
generating code from the AST.
By utilizing the ast package, developers can programmatically analyze, manipulate,
and generate Solidity code. It serves as a foundation for building tools, analyzers,
compilers, and other applications that require deep understanding and processing of
Solidity contracts.

Note: The ast package is designed to be used in conjunction with a Solidity parser,
such as the one provided by ANTLR, to generate the initial AST from Solidity source code.
It then enriches the AST with additional information and functionality specific to the
Solidity language.
