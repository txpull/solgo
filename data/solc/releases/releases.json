the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!\r\nWe are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21). \r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\nImportant Bugfixes:\r\n * Code Generator: Always generate code for the expression in ``\u003cexpression\u003e.selector`` in the legacy code generation pipeline.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step (``i``) not preserving the evaluation order of arguments passed into inlined functions in code that is not in expression-split form (i.e. when using a custom optimizer sequence in which the step not preceded by ``ExpressionSplitter`` (``x``)).\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Features:\r\n * Allow qualified access to events from other contracts.\r\n * Relax restrictions on initialization of immutable variables. Reads and writes may now happen at any point at construction time outside of functions and modifiers. Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompiler Features:\r\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ast-compact-json`` output in assembler mode.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ir-ast-json`` and ``--ir-optimized-ast-json`` outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Respect ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` in compiler mode and accept them in assembler mode as well. ``--optimize --no-optimize-yul`` combination now allows enabling EVM assembly optimizer without enabling Yul optimizer.\r\n * EWasm: Remove EWasm backend.\r\n * Parser: Introduce ``pragma experimental solidity``, which will enable an experimental language mode that, in particular, has no stability guarantees between non-breaking releases and is not suited for production use.\r\n * SMTChecker: Add ``--model-checker-print-query`` CLI option and ``settings.modelChecker.printQuery`` JSON option to output the SMTChecker queries in the SMTLIB2 format. This requires using ``smtlib2`` solver only.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``ast`` file-level output for Yul input.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst`` contract-level outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove experimental ``ReasoningBasedSimplifier`` optimization step.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Stack-to-memory mover is now enabled by default whenever possible for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n * Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types, built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions. The legacy code generation pipeline would not actually evaluate them, discarding any side effects they might have.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix not entirely deterministic order of functions in unoptimized Yul output. The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs emscripten binaries).\r\n * Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--stop-after parsing`` and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.\r\n * Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` at the same time.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside ``if`` and ``ternary conditional``statements in the BMC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only by a trusted external call from another public function.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external function call using function pointer as a public getter.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using external identifier to encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a parameter.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex expressions.\r\n * Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations are no longer convertible to each other.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional files are included during compilation.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step not ignoring code that is not in expression-split form.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul optimizer again before bytecode generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAST Changes:\r\n * AST: Add the ``experimentalSolidity`` field to the ``SourceUnit`` nodes, which indicates whether the experimental parsing mode has been enabled via ``pragma experimental solidity``.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all

the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!\r\nWe are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20). \r\nThis latest version includes a range of improvements and, most importantly, support for Shanghai!\r\nIt also contains performance improvements in the via-IR pipeline and improves the list of events exposed in the contract ABI.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This compiler switches the **default** target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include ``PUSH0`` opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not yet support ``PUSH0``, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Assembler: Use ``push0`` for placing ``0`` on the stack for EVM versions starting from \"Shanghai\". This decreases the deployment and runtime costs.\r\n * EVM: Set default EVM version to \"Shanghai\".\r\n * EVM: Support for the EVM Version \"Shanghai\".\r\n * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``enum`` definitions.\r\n * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``struct`` definitions.\r\n * NatSpec: Include NatSpec from events that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it in userdoc and devdoc output.\r\n * Optimizer: Re-implement simplified version of ``UnusedAssignEliminator`` and ``UnusedStoreEliminator``. It can correctly remove some unused assignments in deeply nested loops that were ignored by the old version.\r\n * Parser: Unary plus is no longer recognized as a unary operator in the AST and triggers an error at the parsing stage (rather than later during the analysis).\r\n * SMTChecker: Group all messages about unsupported language features in a single warning. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-unsupported`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showUnsupported`` can be enabled to show the full list.\r\n * SMTChecker: Properties that are proved safe are now reported explicitly at the end of analysis. By default, only the number of safe properties is shown. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-proved-safe`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showProvedSafe`` can be enabled to show the full list of safe properties.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add experimental support for importing ASTs via Standard JSON.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: If available, use ``push0`` instead of ``codesize`` to produce an arbitrary value on stack in order to create equal stack heights between branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI: Include events in the ABI that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it.\r\n * Immutables: Disallow initialization of immutables in try/catch statements.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false positives in ternary operators that contain verification targets in its branches, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**AST Changes:**\r\n * AST: Add the ``internalFunctionIDs`` field to the AST nodes of contracts containing IDs of functions that may be called via the internal dispatch. The field is a map from function AST IDs to internal dispatch function IDs. These IDs are always generated, but they are only used in via-IR code generation.\r\n * AST: Add the ``usedEvents`` field to ``ContractDefinition`` which contains the AST IDs of all events emitted by the contract as well as all events defined and inherited by the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Alex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, chriseth, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Francois-Rene Rideau, hrkrshnn, Kaan Uzdoğan, Kamil Śliwak, Leo Alt, Matheus Aguiar, Michael de Hoog, minaminao, mmqxyz, Nikola Matic, Nuno Santos, Ojas Aklecha, Peter Lemenkov, Rodrigo Q.

Changelog\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n* Allow defining custom operators for user-defined value types via ``using {f as +} for T global`` syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * SMTChecker: New trusted mode that assumes that any compile-time available code is the actual used code, even in external calls.

The change is due to the renaming introduced by [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399).\r\n * EVM: Introduce ``block.prevrandao`` in Solidity and ``prevrandao()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions \u003e= paris.\r\n * EVM: Set the default EVM version to \"Paris\".\r\n * EVM: Support for the EVM version \"Paris\".\r\n * Language Server: Add basic document hover support.\r\n * Natspec: Add event Natspec inheritance for devdoc.\r\n * Optimizer: Added optimization rule ``and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z)) =\u003e shl(X, and(Y, Z))``.\r\n * Parser: More detailed error messages about invalid version pragmas.\r\n * SMTChecker: Make ``z3`` the default solver for the BMC and CHC engines instead of all solvers.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support Eldarica as a Horn solver for the CHC engine when using the CLI option ``--model-checker-solvers eld``. The binary ``eld`` must be available in the system.\r\n * Solidity Upgrade Tool: Remove ``solidity-upgrade`` tool.\r\n * Standard JSON: Add a boolean field ``settings.metadata.appendCBOR`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.\r\n * TypeChecker: Warn when using deprecated builtin ``selfdestruct``.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Generate more optimal code for user-defined functions that always terminate a transaction. No return labels will be pushed for calls to functions that always terminate.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Allow replacing the previously hard-coded cleanup sequence by specifying custom steps after a colon delimiter (``:``) in the sequence string.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Eliminate ``keccak256`` calls if the value was already calculated by a previous call and can be reused.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Parser: Disallow several ``indexed`` attributes for the same event parameter.\r\n * Parser: Disallow usage of the ``indexed`` attribute for modifier parameters.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix display error for negative integers that are one more than powers of two.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on chain assignments using static fully specified state variables.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on multiple wrong SMTChecker natspec entries.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when a public library function is called internally.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when deleting struct member of function type.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using user-defined types as mapping indices or struct members.\r\n * SMTChecker: Improved readability for large integers that are powers of two or almost powers of two in error messages.\r\n * TypeChecker: Fix bug where private library functions could be attached with ``using for`` outside of their declaration scope.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Hash hex and decimal literals according to their value instead of their representation, improving the detection of equivalent functions.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Alex Beregszaszi, andy53, Anton Paymyshev, Bhargava Shastry, Big-Aaron, Bojidar00, Bulgantamir Gankhuyag, chriseth, Christian Parpart, ChrisXXXXXXX, Damian Wechman, Daniel Kirchner, Doggo, Duc Thanh Nguyen, Franco Victorio, Franziska Heintel, George Plotnikov, hrkrshnn, Ikko Ashimine, Ishtiaque Zahid, John Kane, Kaan Uzdoğan, Kamil Śliwak, Leo Alt, ligi, Lokesh Kumar, Matheus Aguiar, Mathias L.

We have recently migrated our CI builds to Ubuntu 22.04, which includes a backwards-incompatible glibc version. Since the Linux binary is not completely static (it dynamically loads Z3 and consequently glibc), it would not run with older glibc when built against newer one. You can find [more details in the release blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement/#update-2023-02-02-rebuilt-linux-binary-for-solidity-0818) and issue #13921.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: both binaries will produce identical outputs under all circumstances, including the commit hash in the metadata. Only the hash of the compiler binary itself will change due to the replacement, but the new binary will always produce byte-identical output.\r\n\r\nThe SHA-256 hash of the old binary was `a1c0f33eb4482c26f56719ecf62b0ee05d7d7a4f8264ffbddf9ebcd9095c32bd`.

release primarily fixes an [important bug](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/09/08/storage-write-removal-before-conditional-termination/), but also involves some improvements in code generation, optimizer and in the language server.\r\n\r\nFor details, please see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/09/08/solidity-0.8.17-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Prevent the incorrect removal of storage writes before calls to Yul functions that conditionally terminate the external EVM call.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: More efficient overflow checks for multiplication.\r\n * Language Server: Analyze all files in a project by default (can be customized by setting ``'file-load-strategy'`` to ``'directly-opened-and-on-import'`` in LSP settings object).\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Simplify the starting offset of zero-length operations to zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error on tuple assignments with invalid left-hand side.\r\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Fix internal compiler error when accessing the ``.slot`` member of a mapping through a storage reference in inline assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Allow disabling pedantic warnings and do not treat warnings as errors during compiler build when ``-DPEDANTIC=OFF`` flag is passed to CMake.\r\n * Update emscripten to version 3.1.19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially

release fixes one important bug and contains further minor bug fixes and features.\r\n\r\nFor details, please see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generation: Fix data corruption that affected ABI-encoding of calldata values represented by tuples: structs at any nesting level; argument lists of external functions, events and errors; return value lists of external functions. The 32 leading bytes of the first dynamically-encoded value in the tuple would get zeroed when the last component contained a statically-encoded array.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: More efficient code for checked addition and subtraction.\r\n * TypeChecker: Support using library constants in initializers of other constants.\r\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Improved copy routines for arrays with packed storage layout.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to convert ``mod(add(X, Y), A)`` into ``addmod(X, Y, A)``, if ``A`` is a power of two.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to convert ``mod(mul(X, Y), A)`` into ``mulmod(X, Y, A)``, if ``A`` is a power of two.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Disallow the following options outside of the compiler mode: ``--via-ir``,``--metadata-literal``, ``--metadata-hash``, ``--model-checker-show-unproved``, ``--model-checker-div-mod-no-slacks``, ``--model-checker-engine``, ``--model-checker-invariants``, ``--model-checker-solvers``, ``--model-checker-timeout``, ``--model-checker-contracts``, ``--model-checker-targets``.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix compiler crash on tuple assignments involving certain patterns with unary tuples on the left-hand side.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix compiler crash when ``abi.encodeCall`` received a tuple expression instead of an inline tuple.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix null dereference in ``abi.encodeCall`` type checking of free function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Aiman Baharna, Alex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Christian Reitwiessner, CJ42, Damian Wechman, Daniel Kirchner, Daniel Lupu, Derek Gottfrid, Duc Thanh Nguyen, Femi Bolaji, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Ishtiaque Zahid, Kamil Śliwak, krakxn, Matheus Aguiar, Mathias L.

``bytes`` arrays.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Keep all memory side-effects of inline assembly blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Add `E.selector` for a non-anonymous event `E` to access the 32-byte selector topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * LSP: Add rudimentary support for semantic highlighting.\r\n * Type Checker: Warn about assignments involving multiple pushes to storage ``bytes`` that may invalidate references.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Improve inlining heuristics for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI Encoder: When encoding an empty string coming from storage do not add a superfluous empty slot for data.\r\n * Common Subexpression Eliminator: Process assembly items in chunks with maximum size of 2000. It helps to avoid extremely time-consuming searches during code optimization.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Do not remove ``returndatacopy`` in cases in which it might perform out-of-bounds reads that unconditionally revert as out-of-gas. Previously, any \r\n``returndatacopy`` that wrote to memory that was never read from was removed without accounting for the out-of-bounds condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nChristian Parpart, Christian Reitwiessner, Damian Wechman, Daniel Kirchner, Denis T, Dustin Alandzes, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Josep M Sobrepere, Kamil Śliwak, Matheus Aguiar, Mathias L.

announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/05/18/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI Encoder: When ABI-encoding values from calldata that contain nested arrays, correctly validate the nested array length against ``calldatasize()`` in all cases.\r\n * Override Checker: Allow changing data location for parameters only when overriding external functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Assembly-Json Exporter: Include source list in `sourceList` field.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Option ``--pretty-json`` works also with the following options: ``--abi``, ``--asm-json``, ``--ast-compact-json``, ``--devdoc``, ``--storage-layout``, ``--userdoc``.\r\n * Language Server: Allow full filesystem access to language server.\r\n * Peephole Optimizer: Remove operations without side effects before simple terminations.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``abi.encodeCall`` taking into account the called selector.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Assembly-Json Exporter: Fix assembly json export to store jump types of operations in `jumpType` field instead of `value`.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix ABI compatibility with z3 \u003e=4.8.16.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix bug when z3 is selected but not available at runtime.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly check restrictions of ``using ... global`` in conjunction

v0.8.13 fixes an important bug related to ``abi.encodeCall``, extends the ``using for`` directive and implements \"go to definition\" for the language server.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, compiling via the new Yul IR pipeline is now considered production ready.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Correctly encode literals used in ``abi.encodeCall`` in place of fixed bytes arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * General: Allow annotating inline assembly as memory-safe to allow optimizations and stack limit evasion that rely on respecting Solidity's memory model.\r\n * General: ``using M for Type;`` is allowed at file level and ``M`` can now also be a brace-enclosed list of free functions or library functions.\r\n * General: ``using ... for T global;`` is allowed at file level where the user-defined type ``T`` has been defined, resulting in the effect of the statement being available everywhere ``T`` is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Allow the use of ``--via-ir`` in place of ``--experimental-via-ir``.\r\n * Compilation via Yul IR is no longer marked as experimental.\r\n * JSON-AST: Added selector field for errors and events.\r\n * LSP: Implements goto-definition.\r\n * Peephole Optimizer: Optimize comparisons in front of conditional jumps and conditional jumps across a single unconditional jump.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Avoid unnecessary ``pop``s on terminating control flow.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove ``sstore`` and ``mstore`` operations that are never read from.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * General: Fix internal error for locales with unusual capitalization rules. Locale set in the environment is now completely ignored.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix incorrect type checker errors when importing overloaded functions.\r\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Optimize embedded creation code with correct settings. This fixes potential mismatches between the constructor code of a contract compiled in isolation and the bytecode in ``type(C).creationCode``, resp. the bytecode used for ``new C(...)``.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe

types.\r\n * General: Support ``ContractName.functionName`` for ``abi.encodeCall``, in addition to external function pointers.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Event and error signatures are also returned when using ``--hashes``.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove ``mstore`` and ``sstore`` operations if the slot already contains the same value.\r\n * Yul: Emit immutable references for pure yul code when requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Antlr Grammar: Allow builtin names in ``yulPath`` to support ``.address`` in function pointers.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when accessing the members of external functions occupying more than two stack slots.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when doing an explicit conversion from ``string calldata`` to ``bytes``.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Perform proper virtual lookup for modifiers for uninitialized variable and unreachable code analysis.\r\n * General: ``string.concat`` now properly takes strings as arguments and returns ``string memory``. It was accidentally introduced as a copy of ``bytes.concat`` before.\r\n * Immutables: Fix wrong error when the constructor of a base contract uses ``return`` and the derived contract contains immutable variables.\r\n * Inheritance: Consider functions in all ancestors during override analysis.\r\n * IR Generator: Add missing cleanup during the conversion of fixed bytes types to smaller fixed bytes types.\r\n * IR Generator: Add missing cleanup for indexed event arguments of value type.\r\n * IR Generator: Fix internal error when copying reference types in calldata and storage to struct or array members in memory.\r\n * IR Generator: Fix IR syntax error when copying storage arrays of structs containing functions.\r\n * Natspec: Fix internal error when overriding a struct getter with a Natspec-documented return value and the name in the struct is different.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error when a constant variable declaration forward references a struct.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Improved stack shuffling in corner cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solc-Js:**\r\n * The wrapper now requires at least nodejs v10.\r\n * The code has been ported to TypeScript.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Emscripten builds store the embedded WebAssembly binary in LZ4 compressed format and transparently decompress on loading.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Aleksey Bykhun, Amsavarthan Lv, Ayush Shukla, Bhargava Shastry, Braden Watling, Brien, Bruno Barbieri, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Esquith Allen, Franziska Heintel, Hakeem Almidan, Harikrishnan Mulackal, joshieDo, joshuatarkwski, Kamil Śliwak, Laurent, Leo Alt, Markus Waas, Mathias L.

v0.8.10 can now report contract invariants and reentrancy properties through the SMTChecker. It also contains some new optimizations with regards to external function calls and enabled the new EVM code generator for pure Yul mode.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/11/09/solidity-0.8.10-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support ``.address`` and ``.selector`` on external function pointers to access their address and function selector.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Skip existence check for external contract if return data is expected. In this case, the ABI decoder will revert if the contract does not exist.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Accept nested brackets in step sequences passed to ``--yul-optimizations``.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--debug-info`` option for selecting how much extra debug information should be included in the produced EVM assembly and Yul code.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Support ``--asm``, ``--bin``, ``--ir-optimized``, ``--ewasm`` and ``--ewasm-ir`` output selection options in assembler mode.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Use different colors when printing errors, warnings and infos.\r\n * JSON AST: Set absolute paths of imports earlier, in the ``parsing`` stage.\r\n * SMTChecker: Output values for ``block.*``, ``msg.*`` and ``tx.*`` variables that are present in the called functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Report contract invariants and reentrancy properties. This can be enabled via the CLI option ``--model-checker-invariants`` or the Standard JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.invariants``.\r\n * Standard JSON: Accept nested brackets in step sequences passed to ``settings.optimizer.details.yulDetails.optimizerSteps``.\r\n * Standard JSON: Add ``settings.debug.debugInfo`` option for selecting how much extra debug information should be included in the produced EVM assembly and Yul code.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Switch to new optimized code transform when compiling via Yul with enabled optimizer.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Take control-flow side-effects of user-defined functions into account in various optimizer steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix constructor source mappings for immutables.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Disallow ``--error-recovery`` option outside of the compiler mode.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Don't return zero exit code when writing linked files to disk fails.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Fix extra newline character being appended to sources passed through standard input, affecting their hashes.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Report output selection options unsupported by the selected input mode instead of ignoring them.\r\n * Commandline Interface: When linking only accept exact matches for library names passed to the ``--libraries`` option. Library names not prefixed with a file name used to match any library with that name.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in magic type access (``block``, ``msg``, ``tx``).\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in the CHC engine when passing gas in the function options.\r\n * TypeChecker: Fix internal error when using arrays and structs with user defined value types before declaration.\r\n * TypeChecker: Fix internal error when using user defined value types in public library functions.\r\n * TypeChecker: Improved error message for constant variables with (nested) mapping types.\r\n * Yul Assembler: Fix internal error when function names are not unique.\r\n * Yul IR Generator: Do not output empty switches/if-bodies for empty contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes in Experimental Features:**\r\n * Yul IR Generator: Changes to function return variables referenced in modifier invocation arguments were not properly forwarded if there was more than one return variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Pass linker-only emscripten options only when linking.\r\n * Remove obsolete compatibility workaround for emscripten builds.\r\n * Update emscripten to version 2.0.33.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\n4molybdenum2, Adam Bliss, Alex Beregszaszi, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, David

v0.8.8 introduces user defined value types as a major feature, improves overriding interface functions and reading from immutables. Apart from bugfixes, we also cleaned up the command-line interface and improved the way the\r\nimport mechanism resolves files.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/09/27/solidity-0.8.8-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inheritance: A function that overrides only a single interface function does not require the ``override`` specifier.\r\n * Type System: Support ``type(E).min`` and ``type(E).max`` for enums.\r\n * User Defined Value Type: allows creating a zero cost abstraction over a value type with stricter type requirements.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--include-path`` option for specifying extra directories that may contain importable code (e.g. packaged third-party libraries).\r\n * Commandline Interface: Do not implicitly run evm bytecode generation unless needed for the requested output.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Normalize paths specified on the command line and make them relative for files located inside base path and/or include paths.\r\n * Immutable variables can be read at construction time once they are initialized.\r\n * SMTChecker: Add constraints to better correlate ``address(this).balance`` and ``msg.value``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support constants via modules.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support low level ``call`` as external calls to unknown code.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support the ``value`` option for external function calls.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support user defined value types.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix ICE on assigning to calldata structs and statically-sized calldata arrays in inline assembly.\r\n * Code Generator: Use stable source order for ABI functions.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Disallow the ``--experimental-via-ir`` option in Standard JSON, Assembler and Linker modes.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Fix resolution of paths whitelisted with ``--allowed-paths`` or implicitly due to base path, remappings and files being compiled. Correctly handle paths that do not match imports exactly due to being relative, non-normalized or empty.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Report optimizer options as invalid in Standard JSON and linker modes instead of ignoring them.\r\n * Name Resolver: Fix that when importing an aliased symbol using ``import {AliasedName} from \"a.sol\"`` it would use the original name of the symbol and not the aliased one.\r\n * Opcode Optimizer: Prevent the optimizer from running multiple times to avoid potential bytecode differences for referenced code.\r\n * Parser: Properly check for multiple SPDX license identifiers next to each other and validate them.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix BMC's constraints regarding internal functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negative caused by ``push`` on storage array references returned by internal functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false positive in external calls from constructors.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on some multi-source uses of ``abi.*``, cryptographic functions and constants.\r\n * Standard JSON: Fix non-fatal errors in Yul mode being discarded if followed by a fatal error.\r\n * Type Checker: Correct wrong error message in inline assembly complaining about ``.slot`` or ``.offset` not valid when actually ``.length`` was used.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow modifier declarations and definitions in interfaces.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix a crash in LoadResolver, when ``keccak256`` has particular non-identifier arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAhmed Ali,

v0.8.7 introduces support for the [London upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/), includes\r\nvarious improvements to Yul to EVM code transformation, the SMTChecker and some bugfixes.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Introduce global ``block.basefee`` for retrieving the base fee of the current block.\r\n * Yul: Introduce builtin ``basefee()`` for retrieving the base fee of the current block.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * AssemblyStack: Also run opcode-based optimizer when compiling Yul code.\r\n * Commandline Interface: option ``--pretty-json`` works also with ``--standard--json``.\r\n * EVM: Set the default EVM version to \"London\".\r\n * SMTChecker: Do not check underflow and overflow by default.\r\n * SMTChecker: Unproved targets are hidden by default, and the SMTChecker only states how many unproved targets there are. They can be listed using the command line option ``--model-checker-show-unproved`` or the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showUnproved``.\r\n * SMTChecker: new setting to enable/disable encoding of division and modulo with slack variables. The command line option is ``--model-checker-div-mod-slacks`` and the JSON option is ``settings.modelChecker.divModWithSlacks``.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Also pop unused argument slots for functions without return variables (under the same restrictions as for functions with return variables).\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Do not reuse stack slots that immediately become unreachable.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Move function arguments and return variables to memory with the experimental Stack Limit Evader (which is not enabled by default).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix crash when passing an empty string literal to ``bytes.concat()``.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal compiler error when calling functions bound to calldata structs and arrays.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal compiler error when passing a 32-byte hex literal or a zero literal to ``bytes.concat()`` by disallowing such literals.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Apply ``--optimizer-runs`` option in assembly / yul mode.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Fix crash when a directory path is passed to ``--standard-json``.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Read JSON from standard input when ``--standard-json`` gets ``-`` as a file name.\r\n * Standard JSON: Include source location for errors in files with empty name.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error and prevent static calls to unimplemented modifiers.\r\n * Yul Code Generator: Fix internal compiler error when using a long literal with bitwise negation.\r\n * Yul Code Generator: Fix source location references for calls to builtin

0.8.5 allows conversions from ``bytes`` to ``bytesNN`` values, adds the ``verbatim`` builtin function to inject\r\narbitrary bytecode in Yul and fixes several smaller bugs.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please see the [release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allowing conversion from ``bytes`` and ``bytes`` slices to ``bytes1``/.../``bytes32``.\r\n * Yul: Add ``verbatim`` builtin function to inject arbitrary bytecode.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Insert helper functions for panic codes instead of inlining unconditionally. This can reduce costs if many panics (checks) are inserted, but can increase costs where few panics are used.\r\n * EVM: Set the default EVM version to \"Berlin\".\r\n * SMTChecker: Function definitions can be annotated with the custom Natspec tag ``custom:smtchecker abstract-function-nondet`` to be abstracted by a nondeterministic value when called.\r\n * Standard JSON / combined JSON: New artifact \"functionDebugData\" that contains bytecode offsets of entry points of functions and potentially more information in the future.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Evaluate ``keccak256(a, c)``, when the value at memory location ``a`` is known at compile time and ``c`` is a constant ``\u003c= 32``.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * AST: Do not output value of Yul literal if it is not a valid UTF-8 string.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when function arrays are assigned to storage variables and the function types can be implicitly converted but are not identical.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when super would have to skip an unimplemented function in the virtual resolution order.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Assume unimplemented modifiers use a placeholder.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Take internal calls to functions that always revert into account for reporting unused or unassigned variables.\r\n * Function Call Graph: Fix internal error connected with circular constant references.\r\n * Name Resolver: Do not issue shadowing warning if the shadowing name is not directly accessible.\r\n * Natspec: Allow multiple ``@return`` tags on public state variable documentation.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on conversion from ``bytes`` to ``fixed bytes``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on external calls from the constructor.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on struct constructor with fixed bytes member initialized with string literal.\r\n * Source Locations: Properly set source location of scoped blocks.\r\n * Standard JSON: Properly allow

0.8.4 fixes a bug in the ABI decoder, adds custom structured errors, ``bytes.concat(...)`` and allows more flexible configuration of the SMT checker. For more details, please see the [release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\nThe release contains an important bugfix.  See [decoding from memory bug](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/decoding-from-memory-bug/) blog post for more details.\r\n\r\nThe release also implements custom errors. See [custom errors](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/) blog post for an introduction.\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI Decoder V2: For two-dimensional arrays and specially crafted data in memory, the result of ``abi.decode`` can depend on data elsewhere in memory. Calldata decoding is not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Assembly / Yul: Allow hex string literals.\r\n * Possibility to use ``bytes.concat`` with variable number of ``bytes`` and ``bytesNN`` arguments which behaves as a restricted version of `abi.encodePacked` with a more descriptive name.\r\n * Support custom errors via the ``error`` keyword and introduce the ``revert`` statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Analysis: Properly detect circular references to the bytecode of other contracts across all function calls.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Model checker option ``--model-checker-targets`` also accepts ``outOfBounds``.\r\n * Commandline Interface: New model checker option ``--model-checker-contracts`` allows users to select which contracts should be analyzed as the most derived.\r\n * Low-Level Inliner: Inline ordinary jumps to small blocks and jumps to small blocks that terminate.\r\n * NatSpec: Allow ``@notice`` tag on non-public state variables and local variable declarations. The documentation will only be part of the AST, under the field ``documentation``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Deprecate ``pragma experimental SMTChecker;`` and set default model checker engine to ``none``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Report local variables in CHC counterexamples.\r\n * SMTChecker: Report out of bounds index access for arrays and fixed bytes.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support file level functions and constants.\r\n * Standard JSON: Model checker option ``settings.modelChecker.targets`` also accepts ``outOfBounds``.\r\n * Standard JSON: Model checker option ``settings.modelChecker.targets`` takes an array of string targets instead of string of comma separated targets.\r\n * Standard JSON: New model checker option ``settings.modelChecker.contracts`` allows users to select which contracts should be analyzed as the most derived.\r\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Stack Optimization: Reuse slots of unused function arguments and defer allocating stack slots for return variables until after expression statements and assignments that do not reference them.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Added a new step FunctionSpecializer, that specializes a function with its literal arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Antlr Grammar: Fix parsing of import paths involving properly distinguishing between empty and non-empty string literals in general.\r\n * AST Output: Fix ``kind`` field of ``ModifierInvocation`` for base constructor calls.\r\n * Commandline interface: Fix internal error when printing AST and using ``--base-path`` or ``file://`` prefix in imports.\r\n * Commandline interface: Fix standard input bypassing allowed path checks.\r\n * Natspec: Fix internal error related to the `@returns` documentation for a public state variable overriding a function.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false positive and false negative on ``push`` as LHS of a compound assignment.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false positive in contracts that cannot be deployed.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on public getter returning dynamic data on older EVM versions where these are not available.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on try-catch with function call in catch block.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix missing error when events are used without an emit statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n**AST Changes:**\r\n * New property for ``ContractDefinition`` nodes: ``usedErrors`` lists AST IDs of all errors used by the contract (even if defined outside).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Anurag Dashputre, Behrouz, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel

post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/03/23/solidity-0.8.3-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Optimizer: Fix bug on incorrect caching of Keccak-256 hashes.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Command Line Interface: Drop experimental support for ``--machine evm15``.\r\n * Optimizer: Try to move ``and`` with constant inside ``or`` to improve storage writes of small types.\r\n * Optimizer: Replace multiplications and divisions with powers of two by shifts.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * AST Import: For constructors, a public visibility is ignored during importing.\r\n * Error Reporter: Fix handling of carriage return.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in BMC on resolving virtual functions inside branches.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on ``array.pop`` nested inside 1-tuple.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on ``FixedBytes`` constant initialized with string literal.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on array slices.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on calling public getter on a state variable of type array (possibly nested) of structs.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on pushing to ``string`` casted to ``bytes``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix bug in virtual functions called by constructors.\r\n\r\n**AST Changes:**\r\n * ModifierInvocation: Add ``kind`` field which can be ``modifierInvocation`` or ``baseConstructorSpecifier``.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Daniel Kirchner, Djordje

0.8.2 adds an optimizer stage that can inline small amounts of code to save gas and\r\nprovides more means to work with code documentation by exporting inline comments\r\nand allowing custom natspec tags.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed explanation of the new features and changes, please see the [blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/03/02/solidity-0.8.2-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * AST: Export NatSpec comments above each statement as their documentation.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Do not warn anymore about variables or functions being shadowed by EVM opcodes.\r\n * NatSpec: Allow and export all tags that start with ``@custom:``.\r\n * NatSpec: Provide source locations for parsing errors.\r\n * Optimizer: Simple inlining when jumping to small blocks that jump again after a few side-effect free opcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * AST: Added ``referencedDeclaration`` for enum members.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when functions are passed as parameters of other callables, when the function types can be implicitly converted, but not identical.\r\n * Parser: Properly parse ``.address`` in some situations.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix missing type constraints on block and transaction variables in the deployment phase.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error when override specifier is not a contract.\r\n * Type Checker: Make function-hash collision errors into fatal type errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n**AST Changes:**\r\n * Adds ``nameLocation`` to declarations to represent the exact location of the symbolic name.\r\n * Removed the redundant function type \"bytearraypush\" - replaced by \"arraypush\".\r\n * Support

option ``--model-checker-targets`` allows specifying which targets should be checked. The valid options are ``all``, ``constantCondition``, ``underflow``, ``overflow``, ``divByZero``, ``balance``, ``assert``, ``popEmptyArray``, where the default is ``all``. Multiple targets can be chosen at the same time, separated by a comma without spaces: ``underflow,overflow,assert``.\r\n * Command Line Interface: Only accept library addresses with a prefix of ``0x`` in ``--libraries`` commandline option.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule to replace ``iszero(sub(x,y))`` by ``eq(x,y)``.\r\n * Parser: Report meaningful error if parsing a version pragma failed.\r\n * SMTChecker: Output internal and trusted external function calls in a counterexample's transaction trace.\r\n * SMTChecker: Show ``msg.value`` in counterexample transaction traces when greater than 0.\r\n * SMTChecker: Show contract name in counterexample function call.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ABI functions as uninterpreted functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support try/catch statements.\r\n * SMTChecker: Synthesize untrusted functions called externally.\r\n * SMTChecker: Use checked arithmetic by default and support ``unchecked`` blocks.\r\n * Standard JSON: New option ``modelCheckerSettings.targets`` allows specifying which targets should be checked. The valid options are ``all``, ``constantCondition``, ``underflow``, ``overflow``, ``divByZero``, ``balance``, ``assert``, ``popEmptyArray``, where the default is ``all``. Multiple targets can be chosen at the same time, separated by a comma without spaces: ``underflow,overflow,assert``.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix length check when decoding malformed error data in catch clause.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Fix missing error caused by read from/write to uninitialized variables.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negatives in overriding modifiers and functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negatives in the presence of inline assembly.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negatives when analyzing external function calls.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on ``block.chainid``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on pushing string literal to ``bytes`` array.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix missing type constraints for block variables.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix infinite loop when accessing circular constants from inline assembly.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error caused by constant structs containing mappings.\r\n * Type System: Disallow implicit conversion from ``uintN`` to ``intM`` when ``M \u003e N``, and by extension, explicit conversion between the same types is also disallowed.\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Update the soljson.js build to emscripten 2.0.12 and boost 1.75.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, az1az1, Bhargava Shastry,

0.8.0 is a breaking release of the Solidity compiler and language. \r\n\r\nFor a detailed explanation of the new features and changes, please see the [blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes:\r\n* Code Generator: All arithmetic is checked by default. These checks can be disabled using ``unchecked { ... }``.\r\n* Code Generator: Cause a panic if a byte array in storage is accessed whose length is encoded incorrectly.\r\n* Code Generator: Use ``revert`` with error signature ``Panic(uint256)`` and error codes instead of invalid opcode on failing assertions.\r\n* Command Line Interface: JSON fields `abi`, `devdoc`, `userdoc` and `storage-layout` are now sub-objects rather than strings.\r\n* Command Line Interface: Remove the ``--old-reporter`` option.\r\n* Command Line Interface: Remove the legacy ``--ast-json`` option. Only the ``--ast-compact-json`` option is supported now.\r\n* General: Enable ABI coder v2 by default.\r\n* General: Remove global functions ``log0``, ``log1``, ``log2``, ``log3`` and ``log4``.\r\n* Parser: Exponentiation is right associative. ``a**b**c`` is parsed as ``a**(b**c)``.\r\n* Scanner: Remove support for the ``\\b``, ``\\f``, and ``\\v`` escape sequences.\r\n* Standard JSON: Remove the ``legacyAST`` option.\r\n* Type Checker: Function call options can only be given once.\r\n* Type System: Declarations with the name ``this``, ``super`` and ``_`` are disallowed, with the exception of public functions and events.\r\n* Type System: Disallow ``msg.data`` in ``receive()`` function.\r\n* Type System: Disallow ``type(super)``.\r\n* Type System: Disallow enums with more than 256 members.\r\n* Type System: Disallow explicit conversions from negative literals and literals larger than ``type(uint160).max`` to ``address`` type.\r\n* Type System: Disallow the ``byte`` type. It was an alias to ``bytes1``.\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversion to ``address`` type always returns a non-payable ``address`` type. In particular, ``address(u)``, ``address(b)``, ``address(c)`` and ``address(this)`` have the type ``address`` instead of ``address payable`` (Here ``u``, ``b``, and ``c`` are arbitrary variables of type ``uint160``, ``bytes20`` and contract type respectively.)\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversions between two types are disallowed if it changes more than one of sign, width or kind at the same time.\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversions from literals to enums are only allowed if the value fits in the enum.\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversions from literals to integer type is as strict as implicit conversions.\r\n* Type System: Introduce ``address(...).code`` to retrieve the code as ``bytes memory``. The size can be obtained via ``address(...).code.length``, but it will currently always include copying the code.\r\n* Type System: Introduce ``block.chainid`` for retrieving the current chain id.\r\n* Type System: Support ``address(...).codehash`` to retrieve the codehash of an account.\r\n* Type System: The global variables ``tx.origin`` and ``msg.sender`` have type ``address`` instead of ``address payable``.\r\n* Type System: Unary negation can only be used on signed integers, not on unsigned integers.\r\n* View Pure Checker: Mark ``chainid`` as view.\r\n* Yul: Disallow the use of reserved identifiers, such as EVM instructions, even if they are not available in the given dialect / EVM version.\r\n* Yul: The ``assignimmutable`` builtin in the \"EVM with objects\" dialect takes the base offset of the code to modify as an additional argument.\r\n\r\n### Language Features:\r\n* Super constructors can now be called using the member notation e.g. ``M.C(123)``.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n* Type Checker: Perform proper truncating integer arithmetic when using constants in array length expressions.\r\n\r\n### AST Changes:\r\n* New AST Node ``IdentifierPath`` replacing in many places the ``UserDefinedTypeName``.\r\n* New AST Node ``UncheckedBlock`` used for ``unchecked { ... }``.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release

version of Solidity adds better support for calldata types. Furthermore, the fallback function can now have a parameter and explicitly return data. For details, please see the [blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/12/16/solidity-0.7.6-release-announcement).\r\n\r\n### Language Features:\r\n * Code generator: Support conversion from calldata slices to memory and storage arrays.\r\n * Code generator: Support copying dynamically encoded structs from calldata to memory.\r\n * Code generator: Support copying of nested arrays from calldata to memory.\r\n * Scanner: Generate a parser error when comments or unicode strings contain an unbalanced or underflowing set of unicode direction override markers (LRO, RLO, LRE, RLE, PDF).\r\n * The fallback function can now also have a single ``calldata`` argument (equaling ``msg.data``) and return ``bytes memory`` (which will not be ABI-encoded but returned as-is).\r\n * Wasm backend: Add ``i32.select`` and ``i64.select`` instructions.\r\n\r\n### Compiler Features:\r\n * Build System: Optionally support dynamic loading of Z3 and use that mechanism for Linux release builds.\r\n * Code Generator: Avoid memory allocation for default value if it is not used.\r\n * SMTChecker: Apply constant evaluation on binary arithmetic expressions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Create underflow and overflow verification targets for increment/decrement in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Report struct values in counterexamples from CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support early returns in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support getters.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support named arguments in function calls.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support struct constructor.\r\n * Standard-Json: Move the recently introduced ``modelCheckerSettings`` key to ``settings.modelChecker``.\r\n * Standard-Json: Properly filter the requested output artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n * Code generator: Do not pad empty string literals with a single 32-byte zero field in the ABI coder v1.\r\n * NatSpec: Fix segfault when inheriting return parameter documentation for modifiers with no parameters.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix cast string literals to byte arrays.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal compiler error when doing bitwise compound assignment with string literals.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when trying to generate counterexamples with old z3.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix segmentation fault that could occur on certain SMT-enabled sources when no SMT solver was available.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when ``bytes.push()`` is used as the LHS of an assignment.\r\n * Type Checker: ``super`` is not available in libraries.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow leading zeroes in sized-types (e.g. ``bytes000032``), but allow them to be treated as identifiers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix a bug in NameSimplifier where a new name created by NameSimplifier could also be created by NameDispenser.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Removed NameSimplifier from optimization steps available to users.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Đorđe Mijović, franzihei, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Jaime, Kamil Śliwak, Leonardo Alt, Martin Blicha, Mathias Baumann, Matt Williams, midinas, ritzdorf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.7.6.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github

version of Solidity adds a new way to select which ABI coder to use in preparation for making ABI coder v2 the default for 0.8.0. Another notable feature is the option to compile via the new experimental Yul-based compiler pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Language Features\r\n * Ability to select the abi coder using ``pragma abicoder v1`` and ``pragma abicoder v2``.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Use ``.offset`` and ``.length`` for calldata variables of dynamic array type to access their calldata offset and length (number of elements). Both of them can also be assigned to.\r\n * Immutable variables with literal number values are considered pure.\r\n\r\n### Compiler Features\r\n * Assembler: Perform linking in assembly mode when library addresses are provided.\r\n * Command Line Interface: New option ``--experimental-via-ir`` allows switching compilation process to go through the Yul intermediate representation. This is highly experimental and is used for development purposes.\r\n * Command Line Interface: New option ``--model-checker-timeout`` sets a timeout in milliseconds for each individual query performed by the SMTChecker.\r\n * Command Line Interface: Report error if file could not be read in ``--standard-json`` mode.\r\n * Command Line interface: Report proper error for each output file which could not be written. Previously an exception was thrown, and execution aborted, on the first error.\r\n * SMTChecker: Add division by zero checks in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: More precise analysis of external calls using ``this``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``selector`` for expressions with value known at compile-time.\r\n * Standard JSON: New option ``modelCheckerSettings.timeout`` sets a timeout in milliseconds for each individual query performed by the SMTChecker.\r\n * Standard JSON: New option ``settings.viaIR`` allows the same switch as ``--experimental-via-ir`` on the commandline.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n * Code generator: Fix missing creation dependency tracking for abstract contracts.\r\n * Command Line Interface: Fix write error when the directory passed to ``--output-dir`` ends with a slash.\r\n * Command Line Interface: Reject duplicate libraries in ``--libraries`` option instead of arbitrarily choosing one.\r\n * NatSpec: Fix internal error when inheriting return parameter documentation but the parameter names differ between base and inherited.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix CHC false positives when branches are used inside modifiers.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negative in modifier applied multiple times.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix incorrect counterexamples reported by the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in the BMC engine when inherited contract from a different source unit has private state variables.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on conversion from string literal to byte.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when ``array.push()`` is used as the LHS of an assignment.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when assigning state variable via contract's name.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using tuples of rational literals inside the conditional operator.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix lack of reporting potential violations when using only the CHC engine.\r\n * Standard JSON: Fix library addresses specified in ``libraries`` being used for linking even if the file names do not match.\r\n\r\n### AST Changes\r\n * New member ``suffix`` for inline assembly identifiers. Currently supported values are ``\"slot\"``, ``\"offset\"`` and ``\"length\"`` to access the components of a Solidity variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this

v0.7.4 fixes a storage corruption bug of medium severity that occurs when copying empty byte arrays to storage.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the bug and to check if your contract is vulnerable please read this [post](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug) with further details about the bug.\r\n\r\nWe thank John Toman of the Certora development team for finding and reporting the bug.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bug fix, this release contains many small fixes and allows you to define constants at file-level. More details can be found in the [release announcement](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/10/19/solidity-0.7.4-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n### Important Bugfixes\r\n * Code Generator: Fix data corruption bug when copying empty byte arrays from memory or calldata to storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Language Features\r\n * Constants can be defined at file level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compiler Features\r\n * Command Line Interface: New option ``--model-checker-engine`` allows to choose a specific SMTChecker engine. Options are ``all`` (default), ``bmc``, ``chc`` and ``none``.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Print warning for non-empty functions with unnamed return parameters that are not assigned a value in all code paths.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``keccak256``, ``sha256``, ``ripemd160`` and ``ecrecover`` in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support inline arrays.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support variables ``block``, ``msg`` and ``tx`` in the CHC engine.\r\n * Standard JSON: New option ``modelCheckerSettings.engine`` allows to choose a specific SMTChecker engine. Options are ``all`` (default), ``bmc``, ``chc`` and ``none``.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n * Code generator: Fix ``ABIEncoderV2`` pragma from the current module affecting inherited functions and applied modifiers.\r\n * Code generator: Fix internal compiler error when referencing members via module name but not using the reference.\r\n * Code generator: Fix internal error on returning structs containing mappings from library function.\r\n * Code generator: Use revert instead of invalid opcode for out-of-bounds array index access in getter.\r\n * Contract Level Checker: Add missing check against inheriting functions with ABIEncoderV2 return types in ABIEncoderV1 contracts.\r\n * Name Resolver: Fix shadowing/same-name warnings for later declarations.\r\n * Type Checker: Allow arrays of contract types as type expressions and as arguments for ``abi.decode``.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow invalid use of library names as type name.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error caused by storage parameters with nested mappings in libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel

release of Solidity includes a fix for the \"free functions\" feature introduced in the previous release: Two free functions with the same name and parameter types were not considered an error. For more details, please see [the blog post](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/09/28/solidity-0.7.2-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\nThe language support by the SMT checker has also been expanded considerably and the compiler can now export generated internal routines like the ABI encoder and decoder as readable Yul code.\r\n\r\n### Important Bugfixes\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow two or more free functions with identical name (potentially imported and aliased) and parameter types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compiler Features\r\n * Export compiler-generated utility sources via standard-json or combined-json.\r\n * Optimizer: Optimize ``exp`` when base is 0, 1 or 2.\r\n * SMTChecker: Keep knowledge about string literals, even through assignment, and thus support the ``.length`` property properly.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``address`` type conversion with literals, e.g. ``address(0)``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``revert()``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``type(T).min``, ``type(T).max``, and ``type(I).interfaceId``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support compound and, or, and xor operators.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support events and low-level logs.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support fixed bytes index access.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support memory allocation, e.g. ``new bytes(123)``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support shifts.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support structs.\r\n * Type Checker: Explain why oversized hex string literals can not be explicitly converted to a shorter ``bytesNN`` type.\r\n * Type Checker: More detailed error messages why implicit conversions fail.\r\n * Type Checker: Report position of first invalid UTF-8 sequence in ``unicode\"\"`` literals.\r\n * Yul IR Generator: Report source locations related to unimplemented features.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Inline into functions further down in the call graph first.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Prune unused parameters in functions.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Try to simplify function names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n * Code generator: Fix internal error on stripping dynamic types from return parameters on EVM versions without ``RETURNDATACOPY``.\r\n * Type Checker: Add missing check against nested dynamic arrays in ABI encoding functions when ABIEncoderV2 is disabled.\r\n * Type Checker: Correct the error message for invalid named parameter in a call to refer to the right argument.\r\n * Type Checker: Correct the warning for homonymous, but not shadowing declarations.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``virtual`` for modifiers in libraries.\r\n * Type system: Fix internal error on implicit conversion of contract instance to the type of its ``super``.\r\n * Type system: Fix internal error on implicit conversion of string literal to a calldata string.\r\n * Type system: Fix named parameters in overloaded function and event calls being matched incorrectly if the order differs from the declaration.\r\n * ViewPureChecker: Prevent visibility check on constructors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release

release introduces the possibility to define functions at file level. This is a way to define helper-functions that are independent of specific contracts which is much more natural than using internal library functions. Apart from this, the release contains many bugfixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow function definitions outside of contracts, behaving much like internal library functions.\r\n * Code generator: Implementing copying structs from calldata to storage.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Add underflow and overflow as verification conditions in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support bitwise or, xor and not operators.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support conditional operator.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Do not run EVM bytecode code generation, if only Yul IR or EWasm output is requested.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: LoopInvariantCodeMotion can move reading operations outside for-loops as long as the affected area is not modified inside the loop.\r\n * Yul: Report error when using non-string literals for ``datasize()``, ``dataoffset()``, ``linkersymbol()``, ``loadimmutable()``, ``setimmutable()``.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * AST: Remove ``null`` member values also when the compiler is used in standard-json-mode.\r\n * General: Allow `type(Contract).name` for abstract contracts and interfaces.\r\n * Immutables: Disallow assigning immutables more than once during their declaration.\r\n * Immutables: Properly treat complex assignment and increment/decrement as both reading and writing and thus disallow it everywhere for immutable variables.\r\n * Optimizer: Keep side-effects of ``x`` in ``byte(a, shr(b, x))`` even if the constants ``a`` and ``b`` would make the expression zero unconditionally. This optimizer rule is very hard if not impossible to trigger in a way that it can result in invalid code, though.\r\n * References Resolver: Fix internal bug when using constructor for library.\r\n * Scanner: Fix bug where whitespace would be allowed within the ``-\u003e`` token (e.g. ``function f() -   \u003e x {}`` becomes invalid in inline assembly and Yul).\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in BMC function inlining.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on array implicit conversion.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on fixed bytes index access.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on lvalue unary operators with tuples.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on tuple assignment.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on tuples of one element that have tuple type.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix soundness of array ``pop``.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``using for`` directive inside interfaces.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow signed literals as exponent in exponentiation operator.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow structs containing nested mapping in memory as parameters for library functions.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Ensure that Yul keywords are not mistakenly used by the NameDispenser and VarNameCleaners. The bug would manifest as uncompilable code.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Make function inlining order more resilient to whether or not unrelated source files are present.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the

0.7.0 is a breaking release of the Solidity compiler and language.\r\n\r\nThis release does not include many features but rather changes that require a\r\nbackwards-incompatible adjustment in syntax or semantics. For a detailed explanation,\r\nplease see the [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/070-breaking-changes.html).\r\n\r\nMost notably, further cleanup of visibility and state mutability has been performed\r\nand several unpopular keywords have been removed. Types with mappings\r\nin memory are disallowed and shift and exponentiation operations use more reasonable types.\r\n\r\nSince we usually do not backport bugfixes, it is recommended to upgrade all code to be compatible with Solidity v.0.7.0.\r\n\r\nThe [solidity-upgrade tool](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#solidity-upgrade) can help you to semi-automatically upgrade your contracts to breaking language changes. While ``solidity-upgrade`` carries out a large part of the work, your contracts will most likely need further manual adjustments.\r\n\r\nYou can find a guide on how to update your code [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/070-breaking-changes.html#how-to-update-your-code).\r\n\r\nNote that changes listed below are the **changes between 0.6.12 and 0.7.0**. For changes introduced\r\nduring the 0.6.x series, please see the individual changelogs or release announcements on this blog.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Disallow ``.`` in user-defined function and variable names.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Slot and offset of storage pointer variable ``x`` are accessed via ``x.slot`` and ``x.offset`` instead of ``x_slot`` and ``x_offset``.\r\n * JSON AST: Mark hex string literals with ``kind: \"hexString\"``.\r\n * JSON AST: Remove members with ``null`` value from JSON output.\r\n * Parser: Disallow ``gwei`` as identifier.\r\n * Parser: Disallow dot syntax for ``value`` and ``gas``.\r\n * Parser: Disallow non-printable characters in string literals.\r\n * Parser: Introduce Unicode string literals: ``unicode\"😃\"``.\r\n * Parser: NatSpec comments on variables are only allowed for public state variables.\r\n * Parser: Remove the ``finney`` and ``szabo`` denominations.\r\n * Parser: Remove the identifier ``now`` (replaced by ``block.timestamp``).\r\n * Reference Resolver: ``using A for B`` only affects the contract it is mentioned in and not all derived contracts\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``virtual`` for library functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow assignments to state variables that contain nested mappings.\r\n * Type checker: Disallow events with same name and parameter types in inheritance hierarchy.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow shifts by signed types.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow structs and arrays in memory or calldata if they contain nested mappings.\r\n * Type Checker: Exponentiation and shifts of literals by non-literals will always use ``uint256`` or ``int256`` as a type.\r\n * Yul: Disallow consecutive and trailing dots in identifiers. Leading dots were already disallowed.\r\n * Yul: Disallow EVM instruction `pc()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inheritance: Allow overrides to have stricter state mutability: ``view`` can override ``nonpayable`` and ``pure`` can override ``view``.\r\n * Parser: Deprecate visibility for constructors.\r\n * State mutability: Do not issue recommendation for stricter mutability for virtual functions but do issue it for functions that override.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Report multi-transaction counterexamples including the function calls that initiate the transactions. This does not include concrete values for reference types and reentrant calls.\r\n * Variable declarations using the ``var`` keyword are not recognized anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Inheritance: Disallow public state variables overwriting ``pure`` functions.\r\n * NatSpec: Constructors and functions have consistent userdoc output.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when assigning to a 1-tuple.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when tuples have extra effectless parenthesis.\r\n * State Mutability: Constant public state variables are considered ``pure`` functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Fixing deduction issues on function types when function call has named arguments.\r\n * Immutables: Fix internal compiler error when immutables are not assigned.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner,

0.6.10 is a bugfix release that fixes a bug introduced in 0.6.9 related to library functions with calldata parameters that are called via ``using for``. For more details on the bug, pleas see the [blog post](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/06/11/solidity-0610-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the compiler now generates error codes that could be useful for IDEs or automated analysis tools.\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Fixed a bug related to internal library functions with ``calldata`` parameters called via ``using for``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Re-group help screen.\r\n * Output compilation error codes in standard-json and when using ``--error-codes``.\r\n * Yul: Raise warning for switch statements that only have a default and no other cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when encoding tuples of tuples.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix aliasing soundness after pushing to an array pointer.\r\n * Type system: Fix internal compiler error on calling externally a function that returns variables with calldata location.\r\n * Type system: Fix bug

is the first release of Solidity where the solc-js / soljson binary includes the Z3 SMT solver built-in. This means you can use ``pragma experimental SMTChecker;`` even without a local install of z3. Note that this causes an increase in the binary size.\r\n\r\nOn the language side, the ``calldata`` data location for variables and parameters is now allowed everywhere, even in internal functions.\r\n\r\nTo enhance developer experience, the option ``--base-path`` allows you to specify a root path of your contract directory structure to help with imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Permit calldata location for all variables.\r\n * NatSpec: Support NatSpec comments on state variables.\r\n * Yul: EVM instruction `pc()` is marked deprecated and will be removed in the next breaking release.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Build system: Update the soljson.js build to emscripten 1.39.15 and boost 1.73.0 and include Z3 for integrated SMTChecker support without the callback mechanism.\r\n * Build system: Switch the emscripten build from the fastcomp backend to the upstream backend.\r\n * Code Generator: Do not introduce new internal source references for small compiler routines.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Adds new option ``--base-path PATH`` to use the given path as the root of the source tree (defaults to the root of the filesystem).\r\n * SMTChecker: Support array ``length``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support array ``push`` and ``pop``.\r\n * SMTChecker: General support to BitVectors and the bitwise ``and`` operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Trigger proper unimplemented errors on certain array copy operations.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--assemble`` or ``--yul`` options with ``--machine ewasm`` but without specifying ``--yul-dialect``.\r\n * NatSpec: DocString block is terminated when encountering an empty line.\r\n * Optimizer: Fixed a bug in BlockDeDuplicator.\r\n * Scanner: Fix bug when two empty NatSpec comments lead to scanning past EOL.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on try/catch clauses with parameters.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when applying arithmetic operators to fixed point variables.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when assigning to index access inside branches.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when short circuiting Boolean expressions with function calls in state variable initialization.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow assignments to storage variables of type ``mapping``.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow inline arrays of non-nameable types.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow usage of override with non-public state variables.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when accessing members of array slices.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when forward referencing non-literal constants from inline assembly.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when trying to decode too large static arrays.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix wrong compiler error when referencing an overridden function without calling it.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release

release of Solidity fixes three important bugs in the code generator:\r\n - a missing callvalue check for constructors\r\n - a bug connected with array slices for arrays containing dynamic types\r\n - literal strings containing backslash characters in connection with ABIEncoderV2\r\n\r\nIn addition to that:\r\n - we introduced a recommendation to use [SPDX license identifiers](https://spdx.dev/ids/#how) for all source files which are also stored in the contract metadata\r\n - it is possible to access the min and max values of an integer type directly\r\n - WebAssembly support has been extended\r\n\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Add missing callvalue check to the creation code of a contract that does not define a constructor but has a base that does define a constructor.\r\n * Disallow array slices of arrays with dynamically encoded base types.\r\n * String literals containing backslash characters can no longer cause incorrect code to be generated when passed directly to function calls or encoding functions when ABIEncoderV2 is active.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Implemented ``type(T).min`` and ``type(T).max`` for every integer type ``T`` that returns the smallest and largest value representable by the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Don't ignore `--yul-optimizations` in assembly mode.\r\n * Allow using abi encoding functions for calldata array slices without explicit casts.\r\n * Wasm binary output: Implement ``br`` and ``br_if``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI: Skip ``private`` or ``internal`` constructors.\r\n * Fixed an \"Assembly Exception in Bytecode\" error where requested functions were generated twice.\r\n * Natspec: Fixed a bug that ignored ``@return`` tag when no other developer-documentation tags were present.\r\n * Type Checker: Checks if a literal exponent in the ``**`` operation is too large or fractional.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow accessing ``runtimeCode`` for contract types that contain immutable state variables.\r\n * Yul Assembler: Fix source location of variable declarations without value.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the

version 0.6.7 introduces support for EIP-165 via `type(InterfaceName).interfaceId`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Add support for EIP 165 interface identifiers with `type(I).interfaceId`.\r\n * Allow virtual modifiers inside abstract contracts to have empty body.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Optimizer: Simplify repeated AND and OR operations.\r\n * Option to specify optimization steps to be performed by Yul optimizer with `--yul-optimizations` in the commandline interface or `optimizer.details.yulDetails.optimizerSteps` in standard-json.\r\n * Standard Json Input: Support the prefix ``file://`` in the field ``urls``.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when fixed points are used.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using array slices.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``virtual`` and ``override`` for constructors.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix several internal errors by performing size and recursiveness checks of types before the full type checking.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error when assigning to empty tuples.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error when applying unary operators to tuples with empty components.\r\n * Type Checker: Perform recursiveness check on structs declared at the file level.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * soltest.sh: ``SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR`` is no longer relative to ``REPO_ROOT`` to allow for build directories outside of the source tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alex

0.6.5 of Solidity fixes an important bug and introduces ``immutable`` as a major feature.\r\n\r\nThe bug concerns the allocation of dynamic memory arrays using e.g. `new uint[](...)`. The bug is considered to have a severity level of \"low\" but is present in all prior versions of Solidity. Therefore, please read more about how check if your contract is vulnerable in this [blog post](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug/).\r\n\r\nThe immutable feature supports setting contract-level variables at construction time if they do not change later on. These variables are stored directly in the code instead of storage, which makes them extremely cheap to use. For now, only value types are supported.\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Restrict the length of dynamic memory arrays to 64 bits during creation at runtime fixing a possible overflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow local storage variables to be declared without initialization, as long as they are assigned before they are accessed.\r\n * State variables can be marked ``immutable`` which causes them to be read-only, but assignable in the constructor. The value will be stored directly in the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Enable output of storage layout with `--storage-layout`.\r\n * Metadata: Added support for IPFS hashes of large files that need to be split in multiple chunks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Inheritance: Allow public state variables to override functions with dynamic memory types in their return values.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Fix internal error when accessing invalid constant variables.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Fix internal error when accessing functions.\r\n * JSON AST: Always add pointer suffix for memory reference types.\r\n * Reference Resolver: Fix internal error when accessing invalid struct members.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal errors when assigning nested tuples.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, cameel, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner,

0.6.4 of Solidity fixes a bug that did not allow calling base contract functions directly, another bug that caused issues with variable scoping in try/catch and it allows for greater flexibility with regards to storage: It is now possible to set storage slots for storage reference variables from inline assembly. We expect this to allow new patterns in connection to delegatecall proxies and upgradable contracts. Please be careful when using this feature!\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * General: Deprecated `value(...)` and `gas(...)` in favor of `{value: ...}` and `{gas: ...}`\r\n * Inline Assembly: Allow assigning to `_slot` of local storage variable pointers.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Perform control flow analysis on inline assembly. Allows storage returns to be set in assembly only.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * AssemblyStack: Support for source locations (source mappings) and thus debugging Yul sources.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Enable output of experimental optimized IR via ``--ir-optimized``.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Inheritance: Fix incorrect error on calling unimplemented base functions.\r\n * Reference Resolver: Fix scoping issue following try/catch statements.\r\n * Standard-JSON-Interface: Fix a bug related to empty filenames and imports.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal errors when analysing tuples.\r\n * Yul AST Import: correctly import blocks as statements, switch statements and string literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that

long discussions, we finally enabled a high-level way to use the ``create2`` opcode introduced in Constantinople: When creating a contract, you can specify the salt as a \"function call option\": ``new Contract{salt: 0x1234}(arg1, arg2)``. We took this opportunity and also extended the use of these function call options to specifying the gas and value options in external function calls: ``c.f{value: 10, gas: 20000}(arg1, arg2)``.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, interfaces can now inherit from interfaces, making them even more useful for specification purposes.\r\n\r\nTo allow mutation testing and other uses, you can now export the AST, modify it and re-compile starting from the modified ast using `solc --import-ast`. Note that compiling from a modified AST is not meant for production.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, we are now building the javascript compiler solc-js / soljson.js using webassembly which should both provide a performance boost as well as reduce compatibility issues with browsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow accessing external functions via contract and interface names to obtain their selector.\r\n * Allow interfaces to inherit from other interfaces\r\n * Allow gas and value to be set in external function calls using ``c.f{gas: 10000, value: 4 ether}()``.\r\n * Allow specifying the ``salt`` for contract creations and thus the ``create2`` opcode using ``new C{salt: 0x1234, value: 1 ether}(arg1, arg2)``.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support literals ``true`` and ``false``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * LLL: The LLL compiler has been removed.\r\n * General: Raise warning if runtime bytecode exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon).\r\n * General: Support compiling starting from an imported AST. Among others, this can be used for mutation testing.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Apply penalty when trying to rematerialize into loops.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Commandline interface: Only activate yul optimizer if ``--optimize`` is given.\r\n * Fixes internal compiler error on explicitly calling unimplemented base functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Switch to building soljson.js with an embedded base64-encoded wasm binary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, cameel, Chris Chinchilla,

The Yul optimizer only operates on the code generated by ABIEncoderV2 or if you use it in a stand-alone way.

is a major breaking release of the Solidity compiler and language. Changes include explicit virtual and override keywords in inheritance, support for try/catch, splitting the fallback function into a receive Ether function and an actual fallback function and limitations on how the length of an array can be changed, among others. For a detailed explanation, please see the [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/060-breaking-changes.html) or refer to the list below that shows every single change.\r\n\r\nFrom this release on, ABIEncoderV2 is not considered experimental any more, but you still have to activate it through the pragma.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Yul optimizer is automatically activated together with the regular optimizer, but you can still disable it through the detailed optimizer settings.\r\n\r\n**Breaking changes:**\r\n * ABI: Remove the deprecated ``constant`` and ``payable`` fields.\r\n * ABI: The ``type`` field is now required and no longer specified to default to ``function``.\r\n * AST: Inline assembly is exported as structured JSON instead of plain string.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): Introduce context parameter to both ``solidity_compile`` and the callback.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): The provided callback now takes two parameters, kind and data. The callback can then be used for multiple purposes, such has file imports and SMT queries.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): ``solidity_free`` was renamed to ``solidity_reset``. Functions ``solidity_alloc`` and ``solidity_free`` were added.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): ``solidity_compile`` now returns a string that must be explicitly freed via ``solidity_free()``\r\n * Commandline Interface: Remove the text-based AST printer (``--ast``).\r\n * Commandline Interface: Switch to the new error reporter by default. ``--old-reporter`` falls back to the deprecated old error reporter.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Add option to disable or choose hash method between IPFS and Swarm for the bytecode metadata.\r\n * General: Disallow explicit conversions from external function types to ``address`` and add a member called ``address`` to them as replacement.\r\n * General: Enable Yul optimizer as part of standard optimization.\r\n * General: New reserved keywords: ``override``, ``receive``, and ``virtual``.\r\n * General: ``private`` cannot be used together with ``virtual``.\r\n * General: Split unnamed fallback functions into two cases defined using ``fallback()`` and ``receive()``.\r\n * Inheritance: State variable shadowing is now disallowed.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Only strict inline assembly is allowed.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Variable declarations cannot shadow declarations outside the assembly block.\r\n * JSON AST: Replace ``superFunction`` attribute by ``baseFunctions``.\r\n * Natspec JSON Interface: Properly support multiple ``@return`` statements in ``@dev`` documentation and enforce named return parameters to be mentioned in the documentation.\r\n * Source mappings: Add \"modifier depth\" as a fifth field in the source mappings.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add option to disable or choose hash method between IPFS and Swarm for the bytecode metadata.\r\n * Syntax: ``push(element)`` for dynamic storage arrays do not return the new length anymore.\r\n * Syntax: Abstract contracts need to be marked explicitly as abstract by using the ``abstract`` keyword.\r\n * Syntax: ``length`` member of arrays is now always read-only, even for storage arrays.\r\n * Type Checker: Resulting type of exponentiation is equal to the type of the base. Also allow signed types for the base.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow explicit conversions from ``address`` to ``address payable`` via ``payable(...)``.\r\n * Allow global enums and structs.\r\n * Allow public variables to override external functions.\r\n * Allow underscores as delimiters in hex strings.\r\n * Introduce syntax for array slices and implement them for dynamic calldata arrays.\r\n * Introduce ``push()`` for dynamic storage arrays. It returns a reference to the newly allocated element, if applicable.\r\n * Introduce ``virtual`` and ``override`` keywords.\r\n * Introduce ``try``/``catch``-statement\r\n * Modify ``push(element)`` for dynamic storage arrays such that it does not return the new length anymore.\r\n * Yul: Introduce ``leave`` statement that exits the current function.\r\n * JSON AST: Add the function selector of each externally-visible FunctonDefinition to the AST JSON export.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Allow revert strings to be stripped from the binary using the ``--revert-strings`` option or the ``settings.debug.revertStrings`` setting.\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Do not warn about enabled ABIEncoderV2 anymore (the pragma is still needed, though).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Alex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, cd10012, Chris Chinchilla, Christian Parpart, Cory Dickson, Daniel Kirchner, djudjuu, Erik Kundt, Gaith

0.5.14 sets the default EVM version to \"Istanbul\" and is targeted as the last release in the 0.5.x series.\r\n\r\nThe SMT checker supports constructors now and it is possible to directly translate EVM-flavoured Yul to Ewasm from the commandline interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow to obtain the selector of public or external library functions via a member ``.selector``.\r\n * Parser: Allow splitting string and hexadecimal string literals into multiple parts.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support constants that reference other constants.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Allow translation from yul / strict assembly to EWasm using ``solc --yul --yul-dialect evm --machine eWasm``\r\n * Set the default EVM version to \"Istanbul\".\r\n * SMTChecker: Add support to constructors including constructor inheritance.\r\n * Yul: When compiling via Yul, string literals from the Solidity code are kept as string literals if every character is safely printable.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Perform loop-invariant code motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using ``abi.decode``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using arrays or mappings of functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in array of structs type.\r\n * Version Checker: ``^0`` should match ``0.5.0``, but no prerelease.\r\n * Yul: Consider infinite loops and recursion to be not removable.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Update to emscripten version 1.39.3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, Chris Chinchilla, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Erik Kundt, Gaith Hallak, Henry Lee, Lefteris Karapetsas, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann,

0.5.13 provides Istanbul-EVM compatibility (default is still set to Petersburg), is the first version to generate Ethereum-Webassembly (EWasm) binary output (not fully working yet, though), improves the developer experience by listing potential overloads when resolution fails and can output the layout of the storage variables of a contract. As with all other releases, the coverage of the SMT checker is further improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow to obtain the address of a linked library with ``address(LibraryName)``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Use SELFBALANCE opcode for ``address(this).balance`` if using Istanbul EVM.\r\n * EWasm: Experimental EWasm binary output via ``--ewasm`` and as documented in standard-json.\r\n * SMTChecker: Add break/continue support to the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support assignments to multi-dimensional arrays and mappings.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support inheritance and function overriding.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Output the storage layout of a contract when artifact ``storageLayout`` is requested.\r\n * TypeChecker: List possible candidates when overload resolution fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fixed a faulty assert that would wrongly trigger for array sizes exceeding unsigned integer.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when accessing indices of fixed bytes.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using function pointers as arguments.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when implicitly converting string literals to fixed bytes.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow constructor of the same class to be used as modifier.\r\n * Type Checker: Treat magic variables as unknown identifiers in inline assembly.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Chris Chinchilla, Christian

except for reference types.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * ABI Output: Change sorting order of functions from selector to kind, name.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule that replaces the BYTE opcode by 0 if the first argument is larger than 31.\r\n * SMTChecker: Add loop support to the CHC engine.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Take side-effect-freeness of user-defined functions into account.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove redundant mload/sload operations.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when popping a dynamic storage array of mappings.\r\n * Name Resolver: Fix wrong source location when warning on shadowed aliases in import declarations.\r\n * Scanner: Fix multi-line natspec comment parsing with triple slashes when file is encoded with CRLF instead of LF.\r\n * Type System: Fix arrays of recursive structs.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix reordering bug in connection with shifted one and mul/div-instructions in for loop conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all

release fixes a bug related to calldata structs in ABIEncoderV2 and calldata decoding in V1. Several internal bugs of the SMT checker are fixed.\r\nFurthermore, internal types are added to the ABI output which allows you to see which struct type is behind an ABI tuple. Finally, Yul and web assembly support are progressing.\r\n\r\nWe also improved our testing framework which now allows for semantics tests to run in 4 seconds instead of 1 minute.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support direct constants of value type in inline assembly.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * ABI: Additional internal type info in the field ``internalType``.\r\n * eWasm: Highly experimental eWasm output using ``--ewasm`` in the commandline interface or output selection of ``ewasm.wast`` in standard-json.\r\n * Metadata: Update the swarm hash to the current specification, changes ``bzzr0`` to ``bzzr1`` and urls to use ``bzz-raw://``.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Compile only selected sources and contracts.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Provide secondary error locations (e.g. the source position of other conflicting declarations).\r\n * SMTChecker: Do not erase knowledge about storage pointers if another storage pointer is assigned.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support string literal type.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Provide AST even on errors if ``--error-recovery`` commandline switch or StandardCompiler `settings.parserErrorRecovery` is true.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Do not inline function if it would result in expressions being duplicated that are not cheap.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI decoder: Ensure that decoded arrays always point to distinct memory locations.\r\n * Code Generator: Treat dynamically encoded but statically sized arrays and structs in calldata properly.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when inlining functions that contain tuple expressions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix pointer knowledge erasing in loops.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using compound bitwise assignment operators inside branches.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when inlining a function that returns a tuple containing an unsupported type inside a branch.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when inlining functions that use state variables and belong to a different source.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when reporting counterexamples concerning state variables from different source files.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix SMT sort mismatch when using string literals.\r\n * View/Pure Checker: Properly detect state variable access through base class.\r\n * Yul Analyzer: Check availability of data objects already in analysis phase.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix an issue where memory-accessing code was removed even though ``msize`` was used in the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this

from further invisible work on the Yul optimizer, the Solidity to Yul code generation, the eWasm backend and the SMT checker, this release contains two important bug fixes related to storage arrays.\r\n\r\nFor details see https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/06/25/solidity-storage-array-bugs/\r\n\r\nIt also contains an experimental mode that allows recovery from parser error (implemented by @rocky, funded by ConsenSys) in the hope that this might be useful for IDE developers.\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix incorrect abi encoding of storage array of data type that occupy multiple storage slots\r\n * Code Generator: Properly zero out higher order bits in elements of an array of negative numbers when assigning to storage and converting the type at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Commandline Interface: Experimental parser error recovery via the ``--error-recovery`` commandline switch.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule to simplify ``SUB(~0, X)`` to ``NOT(X)``.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Make the optimizer work for all dialects of Yul including eWasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Type Checker: Set state mutability of the function type members ``gas`` and ``value`` to pure (while their return type inherits state mutability from the function type).\r\n * Yul / Inline Assembly Parser: Disallow trailing commas in function call arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Attempt to use stock Z3 cmake files to find Z3 and only fall back to manual discovery.\r\n * CMake: use imported targets for boost.\r\n * Emscripten build: upgrade to boost 1.70.\r\n * Generate a cmake error for gcc versions older than 5.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex

in previous releases, we spent most of the time making Solidity future-proof by further working on the Yul optimizer, the Solidity to Yul (and eWasm) translator and the SMT Checker.\r\n\r\nCode generated from Solidity now always includes the version number in the CBOR metadata so that it becomes possible to quickly assess whether a contract might be affected by a compiler bug or not.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Revert change introduced in 0.5.7: The ``callvalue()`` instruction does not require ``payable`` anymore.\r\n * Static Analyzer: Disallow libraries calling themselves externally.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Assembler: Encode the compiler version in the deployed bytecode.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix handling of structs of dynamic size as constructor parameters.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Disallow the combination of ``msize()`` and the Yul optimizer.\r\n * Metadata: Add IPFS hashes of source files.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule to simplify SHL/SHR combinations.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rules for multiplication and division by left-shifted one.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support inherited state variables.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support tuples and function calls with multiple return values.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``delete``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Inline external function calls to ``this``.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Simplify single-run ``for`` loops to ``if`` statements.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Optimize representation of numbers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Do not inline recursive functions.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Do not remove instructions that affect ``msize()`` if ``msize()`` is used.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Explicitly turn uninitialized internal function pointers into invalid functions when loaded from storage.\r\n * Code Generator: Fix assertion failure when assigning structs containing array of mapping.\r\n * Compiler Internals: Reset the Yul string repository before each compilation, freeing up memory.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix bad cast in base constructor modifier.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when visiting state variable inherited from base class.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in fixed point operations.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in assignment to unsupported type.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in branching when inlining function calls that modify local variables.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Andrey Bronin, asymmetric, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Chris Ward,

release fixes important but very unlikely bugs and further completes ABIEncoderV2, SMTChecker and Yul and improves the optimizer.\r\n\r\nNotably, if ABIEncoderV2 is activated, the ABI decoder will now revert on input with dirty higher order bits instead of ignoring those bits.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix initialization routine of uninitialized internal function pointers in constructor context.\r\n * Type System: Use correct type name for contracts in event parameters when used in libraries. This affected code generation.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix SSA transform for multi-assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Implement encoding of calldata arrays and structs.\r\n * Code Generation: Implement copying recursive structs from storage to memory.\r\n * Yul: Disallow function definitions inside for-loop init blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * ABI Decoder: Raise a runtime error on dirty inputs when using the experimental decoder.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule for shifts by constants larger than 255 for Constantinople.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule to simplify certain ANDs and SHL combinations\r\n * SMTChecker: Support arithmetic compound assignment operators.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support unary increment and decrement for array and mapping access.\r\n * SMTChecker: Show unsupported warning for inline assembly blocks.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support mod.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``contract`` type.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``this`` as address.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support address members.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Metadata settings now re-produce the original ``\"useLiteralContent\"`` setting from the compilation input.\r\n * Yul: Adds break and continue keywords to for-loop syntax.\r\n * Yul: Support ``.`` as part of identifiers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Adds steps for detecting and removing of dead code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Implement Boolean short-circuiting.\r\n * SMTChecker: SSA control-flow did not take into account state variables that were modified inside inlined functions that were called inside branches.\r\n * Type System: Allow direct call to base class functions that have overloads.\r\n * Yul: Properly register functions and disallow shadowing between function variables and variables in the outside scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Soltest: Add commandline option `--test` / `-t` to isoltest which takes a string that allows filtering unit tests.\r\n * soltest.sh: allow environment variable ``SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR`` to specify build folder and add ``--help`` usage.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release

release mainly fixes bugs in the optimizer and in the experimental ABI encoder. For details about the bug, please see the [official announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug/).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this release also allows you to use Yul as a language option (instead of \"Solidity\") in the [standard-json-interface](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description).\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix bugs related to loading short value types from storage when encoding an array or struct from storage.\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix buffer overflow problem when encoding packed array from storage.\r\n * Optimizer: Fix wrong ordering of arguments in byte optimization rule for constants.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Function calls with named arguments now work with overloaded functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Issue error when using ``callvalue()`` inside nonpayable function (in the same way that ``msg.value`` already does).\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Support \"Yul\" as input language.\r\n * SMTChecker: Show callstack together with model if applicable.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support modifiers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Enable stack allocation optimization by default if Yul optimizer is active (disable in ``yulDetails``).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Defensively pad memory for ``type(Contract).name`` to multiples of 32.\r\n * Type System: Detect and disallow internal function pointers as parameters for public/external library functions, even when they are nested/wrapped in structs, arrays or other types.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Properly determine whether a variable can be eliminated during stack compression pass.\r\n * Yul / Inline Assembly Parser: Disallow more than one case statement with the same label inside a switch based on the label's integer value.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Install scripts: Fix boost repository URL for CentOS 6.\r\n * Soltest: Fix hex string update in soltest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Chris Ward, Constantin Kloecker, Daniel

release mainly fixes an optimizer bug related to multiple shift opcodes that was introduced in the previous release. It is unlikely that any existing contracts are affected, but you should still not use Solidity 0.5.5.\r\n\r\nApart from that, the support for calldata structs and arrays by ABIEncoderV2 is almost finished now, we added some more optimizer rules and added enums and one-dimensional arrays to the SMT checker.\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix visitation order bug for the structural simplifier.\r\n * Optimizer: Fix overflow in optimization rule that simplifies double shift by constant.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow calldata arrays with dynamically encoded base types with ABIEncoderV2.\r\n * Allow dynamically encoded calldata structs with ABIEncoderV2.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Optimizer: Add rules for ``lt``-comparisons with constants.\r\n * Peephole Optimizer: Remove double ``iszero`` before ``jumpi``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support enums without typecast.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support one-dimensional arrays.\r\n * Type Checker: Provide better error messages for some literal conversions.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to remove empty default switch cases.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to remove empty cases if no default exists.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to replace a switch with no cases with ``pop(expression)``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * JSON ABI: Json description of library ABIs no longer contains functions with internal types like storage structs.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal compiler error when contract contains too large rational number.\r\n * Type system: Detect if a contract's base uses types that require the experimental abi encoder while the contract still uses the old encoder.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Soltest: Add support for arrays in function signatures.\r\n * Soltest: Add support for struct arrays in function signatures.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.6.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github

release focuses on the stabilization of the ABIEncoderV2 and the optimizer. We also prepared for the Petersburg release which is the default EVM now and improved the SMT checker, such that it now reports less false positives when using ``SafeMath``.\r\nYou can now activate the experimental Yul optimizer using `settings: {optimizer: {enabled: true, details: {yul: true}}}` or in the commandline via `solc --optimize-yul`.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n\r\n * Add support for getters of mappings with ``string`` or ``bytes`` key types.\r\n * Meta programming: Provide access to the name of contracts via ``type(C).name``.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n\r\n * Support ``petersburg`` as ``evmVersion`` and set as default.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Option to activate the experimental yul optimizer using ``-optimize-yul``.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Consider ``extcodehash`` as part of Constantinople.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Instructions unavailable to the currently configured EVM are errors now.\r\n * SMTChecker: Do not report underflow/overflow if they always revert. This removes false positives when using ``SafeMath``.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Allow retrieving metadata without triggering bytecode generation.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Provide fine-grained control over the optimizer via the settings.\r\n * Static Analyzer: Warn about expressions with custom types when they have no effect.\r\n * Optimizer: Add new rules with constants including ``LT``, ``GT``, ``AND`` and ``BYTE``.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule for shifts with constants for Constantinople.\r\n * Optimizer: Combine multiple shifts with constant shift-by values into one.\r\n * Optimizer: Do not mask with 160-bits after ``CREATE`` and ``CREATE2`` as they are guaranteed to return an address or 0.\r\n * Optimizer: Support shifts in the constant optimiser for Constantinople.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to replace switch statements with literals by matching case body.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix internal error related to bare delegatecall.\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix internal error related to ecrecover.\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix internal error related to mappings as library parameters.\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix invalid signature for events containing structs emitted in libraries.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Proper error message for missing variables.\r\n * Optimizer: Fix internal error related to unused tag removal across assemblies. This never generated any invalid code.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix crash related to statically-sized arrays.\r\n * TypeChecker: Fix internal error and disallow index access on contracts and libraries.\r\n * Yul: Properly detect name clashes with functions before their declaration.\r\n * Yul: Take built-in functions into account in the compilability checker.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Properly take reassignments to variables in sub-expressions into account when replacing in the ExpressionSimplifier.\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n\r\n * Soltest: Add support for left-aligned, padded hex literals.\r\n * Soltest: Add support for right-aligned, padded boolean literals.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava

release adds support for calldata structs and packed encoding with ABIEncoderV2. We also introduced some changes to the C API and added support for continuous fuzzing via Google oss-fuzz. In addition to that, we added a new commandline option for improved (colorized) diagnostics formatting.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow calldata structs without dynamically encoded members with ABIEncoderV2.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Implement packed encoding.\r\n * C API (``libsolc`` / raw ``soljson.js``): Introduce ``solidity_free`` method which releases all internal buffers to save memory.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Adds new option ``--new-reporter`` for improved diagnostics formatting\r\n   along with ``--color`` and ``--no-color`` for colorized output to be forced (or explicitly disabled).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Defensively pad allocation of creationCode and runtimeCode to multiples of 32 bytes.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Allow yul optimizer only for strict assembly.\r\n * Parser: Disallow empty import statements.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow mappings with data locations other than ``storage``.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error when a struct array index does not fit into a uint256.\r\n * Type System: Properly report packed encoded size for arrays and structs (mostly unused until now).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Add support for continuous fuzzing via Google oss-fuzz\r\n * SMT: If using Z3, require version 4.6.0 or newer.\r\n * Soltest: Add parser that is used in the file-based unit test environment.\r\n * Ubuntu PPA Packages: Use CVC4 as SMT solver instead of Z3\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex

release adds support for accessing the code of a contract type, which will hopefully make the new `CREATE2` opcode easier to use. We also added some static analysis features to the compiler, but most changes were done \"under the hood\" to pave the way for using the new Yul-based optimizer with ABIEncoderV2.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Provide access to creation and runtime code of contracts via ``type(C).creationCode`` / ``type(C).runtimeCode``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Warn about unreachable code.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support basic typecasts without truncation.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support external function calls and erase all knowledge regarding storage variables and references.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Emscripten: Split simplification rule initialization up further to work around issues with soljson.js in some browsers.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow calldata structs until implemented.\r\n * Type Checker: Return type error if fixed point encoding is attempted instead of throwing ``UnimplementedFeatureError``.\r\n * Yul: Check that arguments to ``dataoffset`` and ``datasize`` are literals at parse time and properly take this into account in the optimizer.\r\n * Yul: Parse number literals for detecting duplicate switch cases.\r\n * Yul: Require switch cases to have the same type.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Emscripten: Upgrade to emscripten 1.38.8 on travis and circleci.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.3.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, androlo, Asher,

release of the Solidity compiler includes several performance optimizations. These include faster compilation time but also cheaper contracts in some situations. This version also checks for all instances of uninitialized storage references, has some improved error messages and other checks.\r\n\r\nYou can now create complete contracts in Yul through the support of the Yul object format and the special functions ``datasize``, ``dataoffset`` and ``datacopy``.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.2.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Detect every access to uninitialized storage pointers.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Improve error messages around invalid function argument count.\r\n * Code Generator: Only check callvalue once if all functions are non-payable.\r\n * Code Generator: Use codecopy for string constants more aggressively.\r\n * Code Generator: Use binary search for dispatch function if more efficient. The size/speed tradeoff can be tuned using ``--optimize-runs``.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support mathematical and cryptographic functions in an uninterpreted way.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support one-dimensional mappings.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Disallow unknown keys in standard JSON input.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Only run code generation if it has been requested. This could lead to unsupported feature errors only being reported at the point where you request bytecode.\r\n * Static Analyzer: Do not warn about unused variables or state mutability for functions with an empty body.\r\n * Type Checker: Add an additional reason to be displayed when type conversion fails.\r\n * Yul: Support object access via ``datasize``, ``dataoffset`` and ``datacopy`` in standalone assembly mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Report specific error message for json input errors instead of internal compiler error.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Replace the trusty PPA build by a static build on cosmic that is used for the trusty package instead.\r\n * Remove support for Visual Studio 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all

release improves the usability of interfaces, fixes some bugs, extends the SMT checker and provides an early preview of the Yul optimizer.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.1.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow mapping type for parameters and return variables of public and external library functions.\r\n * Allow public functions to override external functions.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code generator: Do not perform redundant double cleanup on unsigned integers when loading from calldata.\r\n * Commandline interface: Experimental ``--optimize`` option for assembly mode (``--strict-assembly`` and ``--yul``).\r\n * SMTChecker: SMTLib2 queries and responses passed via standard JSON compiler interface.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``msg``, ``tx`` and ``block`` member variables.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``gasleft()`` and ``blockhash()`` functions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support internal bound function calls.\r\n * Yul: Support Yul objects in ``--assemble``, ``--strict-assembly`` and ``--yul`` commandline options.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Assembly output: Do not mix in/out jump annotations with arguments.\r\n * Commandline interface: Fix crash when using ``--ast`` on empty runtime code.\r\n * Code Generator: Annotate jump from calldata decoder to function as \"jump in\".\r\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error related to state variables of function type access via base contract name.\r\n * Optimizer: Fix nondeterminism bug related to the boost version and constants representation. The bug only resulted in less optimal but still correct code because the generated routine is always verified to be correct.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly detect different return types when overriding an external interface function with a public contract function.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow struct return types for getters of public state variables unless the new ABI encoder is active.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when a field of a struct used as a parameter in a function type has a non-existent type.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow functions ``sha3`` and ``suicide`` also without a function call.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error with ``super`` when base contract function is not implemented.\r\n * Type Checker: Fixed internal error when trying to create abstract contract in some cases.\r\n * Type Checker: Fixed internal error related to double declaration of events.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow inline arrays of mapping type.\r\n * Type Checker: Consider abstract function to be implemented by public state variable.\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * CMake: LLL is not built anymore by default. Must configure it with CMake as `-DLLL=ON`.\r\n * Docker: Includes both Scratch and Alpine images.\r\n * Emscripten: Upgrade to Emscripten SDK 1.37.21 and boost 1.67.\r\n\r\n**Solc-Js:**\r\n * Fix handling of standard-json in the commandline executable.\r\n * Remove support of nodejs 4.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlbert, Alex

This used to log wrong values.\r\n * Type Checker: Report error when using structs in events without experimental ABIEncoderV2. This used to crash or log the wrong values.\r\n * Parser: Consider all unicode line terminators (LF, VF, FF, CR, NEL, LS, PS) for single-line comments\r\n   and string literals.

remaining breaking changes planned for version 0.5.0 that can be implemented in a backwards-compatible way made it into this release. Solidity can now detect uninitialized storage pointers using control-flow analysis. It is again possible to assign multiple return values from a function to newly declared variables and the SMT checker is able to work with simple storage variables.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.24.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Use native shift instructions on target Constantinople.\r\n * General: Allow multiple variables to be declared as part of a tuple assignment, e.g. ``(uint a, uint b) = ...``.\r\n * General: Remove deprecated ``constant`` as function state modifier from documentation and tests (but still leave it as a valid feature).\r\n * Type Checker: Deprecate the ``years`` unit denomination and raise a warning for it (or an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature).\r\n * Type Checker: Make literals (without explicit type casting) an error for tight packing as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Warn about wildcard tuple assignments (this will turn into an error with version 0.5.0).\r\n * Type Checker: Warn when ``keccak256``, ``sha256`` and ``ripemd160`` are not used with a single bytes argument (suggest to use ``abi.encodePacked(...)``). This will turn into an error with version 0.5.0.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Build System: Update internal dependency of jsoncpp to 1.8.4, which introduces more strictness and reduces memory usage.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Add Control Flow Graph as analysis structure.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Warn about returning uninitialized storage pointers.\r\n * Gas Estimator: Only explore paths with higher gas costs. This reduces accuracy but greatly improves the speed of gas estimation.\r\n * Optimizer: Remove unnecessary masking of the result of known short instructions (``ADDRESS``, ``CALLER``, ``ORIGIN`` and ``COINBASE``).\r\n * Parser: Display nicer error messages by showing the actual tokens and not internal names.\r\n * Parser: Use the entire location of the token instead of only its starting position as source location for parser errors.\r\n * SMT Checker: Support state variables of integer and bool type.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fix ``revert`` with reason coming from a state or local string variable.\r\n * Type Checker: Show proper error when trying to ``emit`` a non-event.\r\n * Type Checker: Warn about empty tuple components (this will turn into an error with version 0.5.0).\r\n * Type Checker: The ABI encoding functions are pure and thus can be used for constants.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt,

release: In the previous release, it was possible to define two constructors (one using the new constructor-keyword syntax, another one with the old syntax) for a contract, but only one of them got used in the end. We also included other bugfixes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.23.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Build system: Support Ubuntu Bionic.\r\n * SMTChecker: Integration with CVC4 SMT solver\r\n * Syntax Checker: Warn about functions named \"constructor\".\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Type Checker: Improve error message for failed function overload resolution.\r\n * Type Checker: Do not complain about new-style constructor and fallback function to have the same name.\r\n * Type Checker: Detect multiple constructor declarations in the new syntax and old syntax.\r\n * Type Checker: Explicit conversion of ``bytesXX`` to ``contract`` is properly disallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open

release features several major and long-awaited changes:\r\n\r\n - It is now possible to access dynamic data (arrays, strings, etc) returned by function calls.\r\n - You can specify error reason strings for ``revert`` and ``require`` (support by tooling is still pending).\r\n - We added the global functions ``abi.encode()``, ``abi.encodePacked()``, ``abi.encodeWithSelector()`` and ``abi.encodeWithSignature()`` which expose the ABI encoding functions and each return a ``bytes`` value.\r\n - Constructors should now be defined using ``constructor(uint arg1, uint arg2) { ... }`` to make them stand out and avoid bugs when contracts are renamed but not their constructors.\r\n - Some array operations got cheaper, especially the ``push`` function and initialization of memory arrays.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.22.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Initialize

again introduced several changes that are scheduled for version 0.5.0 and can be activated using `pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\";`. In this release, this pragma does not generate a warning anymore, so you can (and should) use it in production code.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, you can now specify which EVM version the contract should be compiled for. Valid values are \"homestead\", \"tangerineWhistle\", \"spuriousDragon\", \"byzantium\" (the default) and \"constantinople\". Depending on this setting, different opcodes will be used in some cases. The only place where this is currently used by default is that all gas is forwarded with calls starting from \"tangerineWhistle\" (in homestead, some gas has to be retained for the ``call`` opcode itself). Also, the gas estimator reports different costs for the opcodes depending on the version and thus the optimizer might generate different code.\r\n\r\nThe new \"0.5.0\" features are explained in more detail below the list of features and bugfixes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.21.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Assert that ``k != 0`` for ``mulmod(a, b, k)`` and ``addmod(a, b, k)`` as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Code Generator: Do not retain any gas in calls (except if EVM version is set to homestead).\r\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` opcode for calling ``view`` and ``pure`` functions as experimenal 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * General: C99/C++-style scoping rules (instead of JavaScript function scoping) take effect as experimental v0.5.0 feature.\r\n * General: Improved messaging when error spans multiple lines of a sourcefile\r\n * General: Support and recommend using ``emit EventName();`` to call events explicitly.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Enforce strict mode as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Interface: Provide ability to select target EVM version (homestead or byzantium, with byzantium being the default).\r\n * Standard JSON: Reject badly formatted invalid JSON inputs.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow uninitialized storage pointers as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Analyser: Do not warn about experimental features if they do not concern code generation.\r\n * Syntax Analyser: Do not warn about ``pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\"`` and do not set the experimental flag in the bytecode for this.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Mark ``throw`` as an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue error if no visibility is specified on contract functions as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue warning when using overloads of ``address`` on contract instances.\r\n * Type Checker: disallow combining hex numbers and unit denominations as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n\r\n * Assembly: Raise error on oversized number literals in assembly.\r\n * JSON-AST: Add \"documentation\" property to function, event and modifier definition.\r\n * Resolver: Properly determine shadowing for imports with aliases.\r\n * Standalone Assembly: Do not ignore input after closing brace of top level block.\r\n * Standard JSON: Catch errors properly when invalid \"sources\" are passed.\r\n * Standard JSON: Ensure that library addresses supplied are of correct length and hex prefixed.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly detect which array and struct types are unsupported by the old ABI encoder.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly warn when using ``_offset`` and ``_slot`` for constants in inline assembly.\r\n * Commandline interface: throw error if option is unknown\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Dax Bondye, Emilio Almansi, Evgeny Medvedev, Federico Bond, Hongbin Zuo, Oleksii Matiiasevych, Raghav Dua, William Entriken, bernard peh, Aaron Colaço, Alexandre Bezroutchko, Anthony Broad-Crawford, DYLAN BECKWITH, Elena Dimitrova, Furkan Ayhan, Jordi Baylina, Li Xuanji, Zhen Zhang, ankit raj, janat08, mirgj, wbt.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` opcode for calling ``view`` and ``pure`` functions as experimenal 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that functions marked as ``view`` or ``pure`` (previously ``constant``) cannot modify the state. This is especially important if you call unknown code via a generic interface and you cannot be sure whether the function modifies the state or not. This way, ``view`` and ``pure`` functions cannot have reentrancy effects.\r\n\r\n * General: C99/C++-style scoping rules (instead of JavaScript function scoping) take effect as experimental v0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nVariables are no longer valid in the whole function and even before they were declared as in JavaScript, but instead only in the ``{``/``}``-enclosed block where they are declared and only starting after their declaration. These are the rules also used by C++ or Java. There is a common exception where variables declared in the initializing part of the ``for`` header are also valid in the rest of the ``for`` loop construct which we also use in Solidity. Currently, the stack slot reserved for the variable still spans the whole function, but this is planned to be improved for the next release.\r\n\r\n * General: Support and recommend using ``emit EventName();`` to call events explicitly.\r\n\r\nIn order to make events stand out with regards to regular function calls, ``emit EventName()`` as opposed to just ``EventName()`` should now be used to \"call\" events.\r\n\r\n * Inline Assembly: Enforce strict mode as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nStrict mode disallows labels, jumps and opcodes that directly modify the stack. It is much safer than non-strict mode, since you do not have to keep track of the current state of the stack. Furthermore, it allows an optimizer stage (to be finished soon) to be created much more easily. Because of that, the optimizer will refuse to work on non-strict assembly.\r\n\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow uninitialized storage pointers as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nStorage pointers (e.g. ``StructType storage x;``) can lead to severe storage corruption if used without being assigned. In 0.5.0 it will be illegal to declare a storage pointer without directly initializing it.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Mark ``throw`` as an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nThe ``throw`` keyword creates the impression that exceptions are a feature of Solidity, while in reality, it only supports state-reversion that can soon also include error data. Because of that, ``throw`` is deprecated.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue error if no visibility is specified on contract functions as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nSince there were bugs where people did not realize that the default visibility of functions is ``public``, specifying a visibility was made mandatory.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue warning when using overloads of ``address`` on contract instances.\r\n\r\nCollisions between native members of the ``address`` type and user-defined members of contracts can easily deceive users. Because of that, address members are no longer available in contracts. If you want to use an address member (``transfer`` is one of them!), then convert it to address: ``address(contractInstance).transfer(2 wei)``.\r\n\r\n * Type Checker: disallow combining hex numbers and unit denominations as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nWe could not think of any situation where unit denominations like ``seconds`` or ``ether`` combined with hexadecimal literals would be

release includes some usability and security improvements and a further evolution of the SMT component. The ``var`` keyword has been deprecated for security reasons.\r\n\r\nSignificant steps were made in writing optimisation stages for the intermediate language, which will be used by the new ABI encoder to produce highly optimised output. The main goal is to have a resulting bytecode size similar to the old ABI encoder, while having more runtime checks for a stricter decoding process. This is not yet enabled in this release.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Prevent non-view functions in libraries from being called\r\n   directly (as opposed to via delegatecall).\r\n * Commandline interface: Support strict mode of assembly (disallowing jumps,\r\n   instructional opcodes, etc) with the ``--strict-assembly`` switch.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Issue warning for using jump labels (already existed for jump instructions).\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support some restricted tokens (return, byte, address) as identifiers in IULIA mode.\r\n * Optimiser: Replace ``x % 2**i`` by ``x \u0026 (2**i-1)``.\r\n * Resolver: Continue resolving references after the first error.\r\n * Resolver: Suggest alternative identifiers if a given identifier is not found.\r\n * SMT Checker: Take if-else branch conditions into account in the SMT encoding of the program\r\n   variables.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Deprecate the ``var`` keyword (and mark it an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature).\r\n * Type Checker: Allow `this.f.selector` to be a pure expression.\r\n * Type Checker: Issue warning for using ``public`` visibility for interface functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Limit the number of warnings raised for creating abstract contracts.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Error Output: Truncate huge number literals in the middle to avoid output blow-up.\r\n * Parser: Disallow event declarations with no parameter list.\r\n * Standard JSON: Populate the ``sourceLocation`` field in the error list.\r\n * Standard JSON: Properly support contract and library file names containing a colon (such as URLs).\r\n * Type Checker: Suggest the experimental ABI encoder if using ``struct``s as function parameters\r\n   (instead of an internal compiler error).\r\n * Type Checker: Improve error message for wrong struct initialization.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Balajiganapathi S, ChenQuan, Chuck LeDuc Díaz, Evgeny Medvedev, Ezra

the last weeks, we have mainly been working on big internal changes. One of them is the new ABI decoder, which is still in experimental mode, but will hopefully be production-usable soon. External contributions like allowing constant variables for array lengths and improved error messages should make your life as a programmer easier. Finally, the standard-json-io-system now allows to select certain artifacts from a contract which should speed up your code-compile-test-cycle even more!\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: New ABI decoder which supports structs and arbitrarily nested\r\n   arrays and checks input size (activate using ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;``).\r\n * General: Allow constant variables to be used as array length.\r\n * Inline Assembly: ``if`` statement.\r\n * Standard JSON: Support the ``outputSelection`` field for selective compilation of target artifacts.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Turn the usage of ``callcode`` into an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Improve address checksum warning.\r\n * Type Checker: More detailed errors for invalid array lengths (such as division by zero).\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nBalajiganapathi S, Boris Kostenko, Christian Pamidov, Chua Chee Wee, Ezra Epstein, Federico Bond, Francisco

release adds further backwards-incompatible security measures enabled via ``pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\";`` and contains another important feature: You can now select to compile only certain contracts using the ``outputSelection`` field of the [standard-json-io](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#input-description) compiler interface, which should speed up tools like truffle tremendously.\r\n\r\nThere are also two important bug fixes: One was an oversight in the way `bytes` variables are allocated in memory and can reduce the memory requirements 32-fold. The second is a security fix: In extremely specific circumstances, it can happen that a regular function is called instead of the fallback function for an Ether transfer without data. These circumstances are: The function has to have a zero signature (one out of 4294967296), it has to be payable, the contract cannot have more than five (external) functions and it cannot have a fallback function.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Always use all available gas for calls as experimental 0.5.0 feature\r\n   (previously, some amount was retained in order to work in pre-Tangerine-Whistle\r\n   EVM versions)\r\n * Parser: Better error message for unexpected trailing comma in parameter lists.\r\n * Standard JSON: Support the ``outputSelection`` field for selective compilation of supplied sources.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Unary ``+`` is now a syntax error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow non-pure constant state variables as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Do not add members of ``address`` to contracts as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Force interface functions to be external as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Require ``storage`` or ``memory`` keyword for local variables as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Allocate one byte per memory byte array element instead of 32.\r\n * Code Generator: Do not accept data with less than four bytes (truncated function\r\n   signature) for regular function calls - fallback function is invoked instead.\r\n * Optimizer: Remove unused stack computation results.\r\n * Parser: Fix source location of VariableDeclarationStatement.\r\n * Type Checker: Allow ``gas`` in view functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Do not mark event parameters as shadowing state variables.\r\n * Type Checker: Prevent duplicate event declarations.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly check array length and don't rely on an assertion in code generation.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly support overwriting members inherited from ``address`` in a contract\r\n   (such as ``balance``, ``transfer``, etc.)\r\n * Type Checker: Validate each number literal in tuple expressions even if they are not assigned from.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nbenjaminion, bernard peh, Boris

we are getting closer to the next breaking release, we want to give everyone a heads up by introducing `pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\"` which already enables some of the new safety features of the 0.5.0 release.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this release finally checks the modifiers ``view`` (used to be named ``constant``) and ``pure`` on functions. As a rule of thumb, use ``view`` if your function does not modify storage and ``pure`` if it does not even read any state information - but the compiler will also suggest the tightest restriction itself.\r\n\r\nWe also worked further on the new ABI encoder: Functions can now return structs. Switch it on using `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2`. It should already work, but still generates more expensive code.\r\n\r\nFinally, many new warnings were introduced and error messages improved.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Assembly Parser: Support multiple assignment (``x, y := f()``).\r\n * Code Generator: Keep a single copy of encoding functions when using the experimental \"ABIEncoderV2\".\r\n * Code Generator: Partial support for passing ``structs`` as arguments and return parameters (requires ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;`` for now).\r\n * General: Support ``pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\";`` to activate upcoming breaking changes.\r\n * General: Added ``.selector`` member on external function types to retrieve their signature.\r\n * Optimizer: Add new optimization step to remove unused ``JUMPDEST``s.\r\n * Static Analyzer: Warn when using deprecated builtins ``sha3`` and ``suicide``\r\n   (replaced by ``keccak256`` and ``selfdestruct``, introduced in 0.4.2 and 0.2.0, respectively).\r\n * Syntax Checker: Warn if no visibility is specified on contract functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Display helpful warning for unused function arguments/return parameters.\r\n * Type Checker: Do not show the same error multiple times for events.\r\n * Type Checker: Greatly reduce the number of duplicate errors shown for duplicate constructors and functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Warn on using literals as tight packing parameters in ``keccak256``, ``sha3``, ``sha256`` and ``ripemd160``.\r\n * Type Checker: Enforce ``view`` and ``pure``.\r\n * Type Checker: Enforce ``view`` / ``constant`` with error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Enforce fallback functions to be ``external`` as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI JSON: Include all overloaded events.\r\n * Parser: Crash fix related to parseTypeName.\r\n * Type Checker: Allow constant byte arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAli92hm, Aaron Colaço, Lefteris

release introduces several new features, some of which have to be\r\nexplicitly activated using `pragma experimental \u003cfeature name\u003e;`.\r\n\r\nWe split the ``constant`` keyword for functions into ``pure`` (neither reads from nor writes to the state)\r\nand ``view`` (does not modify the state). They are not enforced yet, but will most likely make use\r\nof the the new STATIC_CALL feature after Metropolis.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the ABI encoder was re-implemented in a much cleaner way using our new intermediate language. It can encode arbitrarily nested arrays and will also be able to encode structs starting from the next release. Please try it out using `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;` and check if you have any issues with the encoder. It currently generates larger code than the old encoder, but we hope to fix that soon.\r\n\r\nFinally, solc now include experimental support for automated overflow and assertion checking at compile-time using the SMT solver Z3. It is active if you use `pragma experimental SMTChecker;` and if solc was compiled with Z3 support. The latter is currently only the case for the PPA builds (or if you build from source and have libz3-dev in your system), but we also have a solution in the pipeline that will make it work for solc-js (and thus remix).\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * ABI JSON: Include new field ``stateMutability`` with values ``pure``, ``view``, ``nonpayable`` and ``payable``.\r\n * Analyzer: Experimental partial support for Z3 SMT checker (\"SMTChecker\").\r\n * Build System: Shared libraries (``libdevcore``, ``libevmasm``, ``libsolidity`` and ``liblll``) are no longer produced during the build process.\r\n * Code generator: Experimental new implementation of ABI encoder that can encode arbitrarily nested arrays (\"ABIEncoderV2\")\r\n * Metadata: Store experimental flag in metadata CBOR.\r\n * Parser: Display previous visibility specifier in error if multiple are found.\r\n * Parser: Introduce ``pure`` and ``view`` keyword for functions, ``constant`` remains an alias for ``view`` and pureness is not enforced yet, so use with care.\r\n * Static Analyzer: Warn about large storage structures.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Support ``pragma experimental \u003cfeature\u003e;`` to turn on experimental features.\r\n * Type Checker: More detailed error message for invalid overrides.\r\n * Type Checker: Warn about shifting a literal.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Assembly Parser: Be more strict about number literals.\r\n * Assembly Parser: Limit maximum recursion depth.\r\n * Parser: Enforce commas between array and tuple elements.\r\n * Parser: Limit maximum recursion depth.\r\n * Type Checker: Crash fix related to ``using``.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow constructors in libraries.\r\n * Type Checker: Reject the creation of interface contracts using the ``new`` statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nChim Kan, Federico Bond, feliam, gubatron, Isaac Ibiapina, James Ray, Joshua Hannan, Lea Arias, Nick Savers, Stu West, Vladislav Ankudinov and Zhen Zhang\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.16.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github

release contains several new features and bugfixes and also an important security fix: The ``ecrecover`` function can be forced to return invalid data, which can be used to bypass authentication in very special circumstances.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n * C API (``jsonCompiler``): Export the ``license`` method.\r\n * Code Generator: Optimise the fallback function, by removing a useless jump.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Show useful error message if trying to access calldata variables.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support variable declaration without initial value (defaults to 0).\r\n * Metadata: Only include files which were used to compile the given contract.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow value transfers to contracts without a payable fallback function.\r\n * Type Checker: Include types in explicit conversion error message.\r\n * Type Checker: Raise proper error for arrays too large for ABI encoding.\r\n * Type checker: Warn if using ``this`` in a constructor.\r\n * Type checker: Warn when existing symbols, including builtins, are overwritten.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n * Code Generator: Properly clear return memory area for ecrecover.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix crash for some assignment to

and ``RETURNDATACOPY`` (EIP211) instructions.\r\n * Assembly: Display auxiliary data in the assembly output.\r\n * Assembly: Renamed ``SHA3`` to ``KECCAK256``.\r\n * AST: export all attributes to JSON

release fixes a bug in the optimizer (more about this on the [blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/05/03/solidity-optimizer-bug/)), introduces the standard JSON interface, adds ``interface`` contracts and implements some additional safety checks.\r\n\r\nThe standard [JSON interface](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description) provides a unified way to invoke the Solidity compiler in order to ease cross-platform adoption and compilation verification.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Implement the Standard JSON Input / Output API\r\n * Support ``interface`` contracts.\r\n * C API (``jsonCompiler``): Add the ``compileStandard()`` method to process a Standard JSON I/O.\r\n * Commandline interface: Add the ``--standard-json`` parameter to process a Standard JSON I/O.\r\n * Commandline interface: Support ``--allow-paths`` to define trusted import paths. Note: the\r\n   path(s) of the supplied source file(s) is always trusted.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Storage variable access using ``_slot`` and ``_offset`` suffixes.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Disallow blocks with unbalanced stack.\r\n * Static analyzer: Warn about statements without effects.\r\n * Static analyzer: Warn about unused local variables, parameters, and return parameters.\r\n * Syntax checker: issue deprecation warning for unary '+'\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Assembly output: Implement missing AssemblyItem types.\r\n * Compiler interface: Fix a bug where source indexes could be inconsistent between Solidity compiled\r\n   with different compilers (clang vs. gcc) or compiler settings. The bug was visible in AST\r\n   and source mappings.\r\n * Gas Estimator: Reflect the most recent fee schedule.\r\n * Type system: Contract inheriting from base with unimplemented constructor should be abstract.\r\n * Optimizer: Number representation bug in the constant optimizer fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAbraham Sangha, AdrianClv, Andy Milenius, Chandan Kumar, Federico Bond, FedericoCapello, JohnAllen, Matt Searle, Matt Wisniewski, Morgan, Omkara and Rhett Aultman\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.11.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n**Update**: the original release on 3rd of May contained the wrong version numbers (it included the pre-release tag).

release is focused on stability and also introduces some new smart contract safety features: ``require``, ``assert`` and ``transfer``. Note that the new ``revert`` function will only be gas-efficient starting from homestead.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Add ``assert(condition)``, which throws if condition is false (meant for internal errors).\r\n * Add ``require(condition)``, which throws if condition is false (meant for invalid input).\r\n * Commandline interface: Do not overwrite files unless forced.\r\n * Introduce ``.transfer(value)`` for sending Ether.\r\n * Code generator: Support ``revert()`` to abort with rolling back, but not consuming all gas.\r\n * Inline assembly: Support ``revert`` (EIP140) as an opcode.\r\n * Parser: Support scientific notation in numbers (e.g. ``2e8`` and ``200e-2``).\r\n * Type system: Support explicit conversion of external function to address.\r\n * Type system: Warn if base of exponentiation is literal (result type might be unexpected).\r\n * Type system: Warn if constant state variables are not compile-time constants.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Commandline interface: Always escape filenames (replace ``/``, ``:`` and ``.`` with ``_``).\r\n * Commandline interface: Do not try creating paths ``.`` and ``..``.\r\n * Commandline interface: Allow long library names.\r\n * Parser: Disallow octal literals.\r\n * Type system: Fix a crash caused by continuing on fatal errors in the code.\r\n * Type system: Disallow compound assignment for tuples.\r\n * Type system: Detect cyclic dependencies between constants.\r\n * Type system: Disallow arrays with negative length.\r\n * Type system: Fix a crash related to invalid binary operators.\r\n * Type system: Disallow ``var`` declaration with empty tuple type.\r\n * Type system: Correctly convert function argument types to pointers for member functions.\r\n * Type system: Move privateness of constructor

release fixes quite some bugs and also adds several new features.\n\nThings to look out for:\n- To disambiguate contracts and libraries of the same name in different files, everything is now prefixed by \"filename:\". This applies to the compiler output, the linker input and other things.\n- Internal exceptions are now thrown by using an invalid opcode (0xfe), manual exceptions still use an invalid jump.\n\nFeatures:\n- Compiler interface: Contracts and libraries can be referenced with a `file:` prefix to make them unique.\n- Compiler interface: Report source location for \"stack too deep\" errors.\n- AST: Use deterministic node identifiers.\n- Inline assembly: introduce `invalid` (EIP141) as an opcode.\n- Type system: Introduce type identifier strings.\n- Type checker: Warn about invalid checksum for addresses and deduce type from valid ones.\n- Metadata: Do not include platform in the version number.\n- Metadata: Add option to store sources as literal content.\n- Code generator: Extract array utils into low-level functions.\n- Code generator: Internal errors (array out of bounds, etc.) now cause a reversion by using an invalid\n  instruction (0xfe - EIP141) instead of an invalid jump. Invalid jump is still kept for explicit throws.\n\nBugfixes:\n- Code generator: Allow recursive structs.\n- Inline assembly: Disallow variables named like opcodes.\n- Type checker: Allow multiple events of the same name (but with different arities or argument types)\n- Natspec parser: Fix error with `@param` parsing and whitespace.\n","reactions":{"url":"","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"author":{"login":"chriseth","id":9073706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth","html_url":"https://github.com/chriseth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/5151856","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/5151856/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/5151856/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.8","id":5151856,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTUxNTE4NTY=","tag_name":"v0.4.8","target_commitish":"release","name":"Version

Solidity release adds [function types](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#function-types). Use-cases include supplying callbacks for asynchronous or off-chain operations or generic library features (for example map-reduce-style programming). This release also improves the safety of enums and sending Ether to a contract constructor.\n\nFeatures:\n- Function types\n- Do-while loops: support for a `do \u003cblock\u003e while (\u003cexpr\u003e);` control structure\n- Inline assembly: support `invalidJumpLabel` as a jump label.\n- Type checker: now more eagerly searches for a common type of an inline array with mixed types\n- Code generator: generates a runtime error when an out-of-range value is converted into an enum type.\n\nBugfixes:\n- Inline assembly: calculate stack height warning correctly even when local variables are used.\n- Code generator: check for value transfer in non-payable constructors.\n- Parser: disallow empty enum definitions.\n- Type checker: disallow conversion between different enum types.\n- Interface JSON: do not include trailing new line.\n\nSwarm hash of js compiler:

is a real bugfix release as you can see from the changelog below. The most important fix concerns the optimizer which generated invalid code connected to the `SHA3` opcode in certain situations.\n\nFeatures:\n- Inline assembly: support both `suicide` and `selfdestruct` opcodes\n  (note: `suicide` is deprecated).\n- Inline assembly: issue warning if stack is not balanced after block.\n- Include `keccak256()` as an alias to `sha3()`.\n- Support shifting constant numbers.\n\nBugfixes:\n- Commandline interface: Disallow unknown options in `solc`.\n- Name resolver: Allow inheritance of `enum` definitions.\n- Type checker: Proper type checking for bound functions.\n- Type checker: fixed crash related to invalid fixed point constants\n- Type checker: fixed crash related to invalid literal numbers.\n- Type checker: `super.x` does not look up `x` in the current contract.\n- Code generator: expect zero stack increase after `super` as an expression.\n- Code generator: fix an internal compiler error for `L.Foo` for `enum Foo` defined in library `L`.\n- Code generator: allow inheritance of `enum` definitions.\n- Inline assembly: support the `address` opcode.\n- Inline assembly: fix parsing of assignment after a label.\n- Inline assembly: external variables of unsupported type (such as `this`, `super`, etc.)\n  are properly detected as unusable.\n- Inline assembly: support variables within modifiers.\n- Optimizer: fix related to stale knowledge about SHA3 operations\n","reactions":{"url":"","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"author":{"login":"chriseth","id":9073706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth","html_url":"https://github.com/chriseth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/4159082","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/4159082/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/4159082/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.2","id":4159082,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQxNTkwODI=","tag_name":"v0.4.2","target_commitish":"release","name":"Version

Version 0.4.0 is unable to compile libraries. Please upgrade to 0.4.1.\n\nThis release deliberately breaks backwards compatibility mostly to enforce some safety features. The most important change is that you have to explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the `payable` modifier. Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.\n\nMinimal changes to be made for upgrade:\n- Add `payable` to all functions that want to receive Ether (including the constructor and the fallback function).\n- Change `_` to `_;` in modifiers.\n- Add version pragma to each file: `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`\n\nBreaking Changes:\n- Source files have to specify the compiler version they are compatible with using e.g. `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;` or\n  `pragma solidity \u003e=0.4.0 \u003c0.4.8;`\n- Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the\n  new `payable` modifier (otherwise they throw).\n- Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain \"send\"\n  have to implement a fallback function with the `payable`\n  modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback\n  function is defined and no function matches the signature.\n- Failing contract creation through \"new\" throws.\n- Division / modulus by zero throws.\n- Function call throws if target contract does not have code\n- Modifiers are required to contain `_` (use `if (false) _` as a workaround if needed).\n- Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after `_`.\n- Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.\n- `ecrecover` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).\n- The `constant` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.\n- Removed `--interface` (Solidity interface) output option\n- JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.\n- JSON output: `srcmap-runtime` renamed to `srcmapRuntime`.\n- Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std\n  (`import \"std\";` or `import owned;` do not work anymore).\n- Confusing and undocumented keyword `after` was removed.\n- New reserved words: `abstract`, `hex`, `interface`, `payable`, `pure`, `static`, `view`.\n\nFeatures:\n- Hexadecimal string literals: `hex\"ab1248fe\"`\n- Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.\n- Commandline interface: Using `-` as filename allows reading from stdin.\n- Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.\n- Interface: Version string now _semver_ compatible.\n- Code generator: Do not provide \"new account gas\" if we know the called account exists.\n\nBugfixes:\n- JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent\n- Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation\n- Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.\n- Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.\n- Code Generator: Fix crash when `sha3()` was used on unsupported types.\n- Code Generator: Manually set gas stipend for `.send(0)`.\n\nLots of changes to the documentation mainly by voluntary external contributors.\n","reactions":{"url":"","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"author":{"login":"chriseth","id":9073706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth","html_url":"https://github.com/chriseth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/3859219","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/3859219/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/3859219/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.3.6","id":3859219,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM4NTkyMTk=","tag_name":"v0.3.6","target_commitish":"develop","name":"Version 0.3.6","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2016-08-10T19:07:15Z","published_at":"2016-08-10T19:09:12Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/tarball/v0.3.6","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/zipball/v0.3.6","body":"This is the first release from the new \"solidity-standalone\" repository.

release includes three major features and one very important bugfix in the optimizer.\r\n\r\nIn some situations, the optimizer generated incorrect code. Please always test your code before you use it, unfortunately, we can never guarantee 100% correctness.\r\n\r\nWe are especially grateful about the many voluntary community contributions this release received.\r\nTwo fearless individuals dived deep into the solidity code and delivered two major features: Thanks a lot to @VoR0220 for the inline arrays and to @guanqun for the ternary operator!\r\nFurthermore, @bobsummerwill spent a lot of free time handling build issues on MacOS and other platforms.\r\nOther contributions came from @axic, @chfast, @ethers, @janx, @pipermerriam and @u2.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- **Inline arrays**, i.e. `var y = [1,x,f()];` if there is a common type for `1`, `x` and `f()`. Note that the result is always a fixed-length memory array and conversion to dynamic-length memory arrays is not yet possible.\r\n- **Import** similar to ECMAScript6 import (`import \"abc.sol\" as d` and `import {x, y} from \"abc.sol\"`). [Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#importing-other-source-files) \r\n- Commandline compiler solc automatically resolves missing imports and allows for \"include directories\". [Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#use-in-actual-compilers)\r\n- **Conditional** / ternary operator: `x ? y : z`\r\n\r\nFixed bugs:\r\n- Several bugs where the optimizer generated invalid code.\r\n- Enums and structs were not accessible to other contracts.\r\n- Fixed segfault connected to function paramater types, appeared during gas estimation.\r\n- Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.\r\n- Allow function overloads with different array types.\r\n- Allow assignments of type `(x) = 7`.\r\n- Type `uint176` was not available.\r\n- Fixed crash during type checking concerning constructor calls.\r\n- Fixed crash during code generation concerning invalid accessors for struct types.\r\n- Fixed crash during code generating concerning computing a hash of a struct type.\r\n\r\nnote: The source below cannot be used without the dependent repositories.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"author":{"login":"chriseth","id":9073706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth","html_url":"https://github.com/chriseth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/2213759","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/2213759/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/2213759/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.2.0","id":2213759,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIyMTM3NTk=","tag_name":"v0.2.0","target_commitish":"develop","name":"Version 0.2.0 (breaking change)","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2015-12-01T15:20:49Z","published_at":"2015-12-01T15:21:29Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/releases/assets/26562646","id":26562646,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI2NTYyNjQ2","name":"soljson.js","label":"","uploader":{"login":"cameel","id":137030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel","html_url":"https://github.com/cameel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-javascript","state":"uploaded","size":6729443,"download_count":13,"created_at":"2020-10-05T13:30:06Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T13:30:10Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.2.0/soljson.js"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/tarball/v0.2.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ethereum/solidity/zipball/v0.2.0","body":"Features:\r\n- Allocation of memory arrays using `new`.\r\n- Binding library functions to types via `using x for y`\r\n- **Breaking Change**: `new ContractName.value(10)()` has to be written as `(new ContractName).value(10)()`\r\n- Added `selfdestruct` as an alias for `suicide`.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n- Constructor arguments of fixed array type were not read correctly.\r\n- Memory allocation of structs containing arrays or strings.\r\n- Data location for explicit memory parameters in libraries was set to storage.\r\n\r\nThe two main features of this release is the ability to create memory arrays (of dynamic length) and to\r\n[attach library functions to types](https://ethereum.github.io/solidity//docs/using-for/).
